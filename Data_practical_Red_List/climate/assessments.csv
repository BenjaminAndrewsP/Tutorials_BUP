1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that Allotoca goslinei was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus et al. (2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (Salix spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. Allotoca goslinei was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a Nasturtium-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, Moxostoma mascotae (now: Moxostoma austrinum), a Goodeid, Allodontichthys n. sp. (now: Allodontichthys polylepis) and a Poeciliid, Poeciliopsis infans. Rana sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned Ilyodon furcidens being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez et al. 2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb et al. 2004). Schindler reported to Hieronimus (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","Allotoca goslinei was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) occurred, which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while Allotoca goslinei decreased in abundance. The Swordtail is thought to have displaced Allotoca goslinei through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus et al. 2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989).","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus et al. in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus et al. 2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000 Alloctoca goslinei was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found. Based on this, the Banded Allotoca is feared to be Extinct in the Wild (Lyons 2011). A few captive strains do exist in Europe, Mexico and the United States, but all of them are low in numbers and not easy to maintain.","","The Banded Allotoca was endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco and historically only known from few collections in the headwaters of the Río Ameca, namely from the type location, the Río Grande (or Río, Arroyo, Potrero Grande about 10 km west of the town of Ameca), and from the Río Cuisillos (1 km east of the train station at Pacana near the Presa La Vega, where it coalesces with the Río Salado forming up the Río Ameca) (Smith and Miller 1987). From this distribution pattern, it can be inferred that it was more widespread in the headwaters of the Río Ameca drainage, but stayed either unnoticed or was very scarce. However, it was eliminated from the Río Ameca by the late 1990's, but remained moderately common in the Río Potrero Grande (Lyons 2011), until non-native swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) invaded the river after 2000. Being the dominant species in 2000, with about 75% proportional abundance, the numbers of Allotoca goslinei declined rapidly thereafter, and extensive samplings in 2005 and 2006 didn't show a single individual (Helmus et al. 2009). The last record dates back to 2004 (Lyons 2011).",The Banded Allotoca is not used for consumption and is not a target species for the ornamental fish trade.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The Banded Allotoca is included in the international ex-situ breeding project ""Allotoca-Mesa Central"" from the Austrian Association of Aquarists (ÖVVÖ) for all species of the genera Allotoca and Neoophorus (http://www.oevvoe.org/allotoca-mesa-central). Other conservation effort is a monitoring and ex-situ breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biología Acuatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, MexicoNo other conservation efforts for this species are known. ",Neotropical,2004,false,false,Global

Population declines were first noted in the 1970s when lake levels were lowered. In 1988 a massive outflow event resulted in a catastrophic drop in lake level of 60 cm, isolating the zone were the species is normally found. This combined with interference of inflow streams, and hot, dry summers have led to extensive damage to the entire lake's littoral zone. Repeated visits to the area between 1992 and 2000 failed to locate the species leading to the conclusion that the species should be considered extinct. However some shells of this species were collected in 2009 (Fischer et al. 2009), so there are two possible conclusions a) these are subfossil shells washed out from sediment b) that it is possible that the species may have survived in a small groundwater source and that species is extant. As the species was not live collected, it is still considered Extinct, however if more dead shells continue to be found then the species should be considered as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) and intensive surveys and rehabilitation programmes will be required.

The last subpopulation of this species in situ was extirpated around 2015, confirmed by exhaustive surveys, and the New Zealand Threat Classification System assessed this species as ‘Threatened / Nationally Critical’ Qualified ‘Conservation Dependent' and ‘Extinct in the Wild' (de Lange et al. 2018). The species is here assessed as Extinct in the Wild.","The ecology of Clianthus puniceus is unknown, though it was likely to have been like that reported for Clianthus magnificus by Shaw and Burns (1997) (as Clianthus puniceus) which is typically found in early to mid-successional shrubland habitats often dominated by harakeke (Phormium tenax), wharariki (Phormium cookianum = P. colensoi; POWO 2023) and tutu (Coriaria arborea var. arborea) in coastal and lowland habitats. On Moturemu Island plants grew at the base of an unstable cliff face in colluvium in low windshorn coastal shrubland. As with Clianthus magnificus the exact ecology of Clianthus puniceus is muddied by the fact it was planted widely by Māori, and it is possible that some sites stem from past plantings (de Lange et al. 2010, de Lange 2023).","Clianthus puniceus was already a scarce plant by the time resident botanists started exploring the flora of Aotearoa / New Zealand. Few genuinely wild occurrences were reported between the 1830's and 1960's and it is possible that all the sites noted in literature stem from Māori plantings. The reason for this species' scarcity is not clear but irrespective, it has the same vulnerabilities known from Clianthus magnificus i.e., susceptibility to browsing animals such as feral goats (Capra hircus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). At Moturemu Island plants were reported in the 1960's and 1970's then again in the late 1980's and early 1990's. At this site it was surmised that plants were growing in suboptimal conditions – on the assumption at that time that the ecology of Clianthus magnificus and Clianthus puniceus (then treated as one species) were the same (Shaw and Burns 1997). This led to seedlings being removed from the island and grown on in ‘safe sites’ on Tiritirimatangi Island and the Auckland Botanic Gardens. The Moturemu Island plants were noted to be short-lived, succumbing to drought, rat browsing (despite rat control) and being outcompeted by taller woody invasive plants. The loss of the Moturemu Island population was probably hastened by the inaccessibility of the location which prevented regular monitoring.","There are no wild plants / subpopulations known of this species. The species is now regarded as ‘Extinct in the Wild’, the last known wild subpopulation (Moturemu Island, Kaipara Harbour) died out about 2015 (de Lange et al. 2018).","","This species is endemic to Aotearoa / New Zealand, where it occurred on Te Ika a Maui / North Island. As circumscribed by Heenan (2000) it was known only from Auckland and Northland. There are no extant subpopulations, the last wild one, found on Moturemu Island, Kaipara Harbour was extirpated c. 2015. Few herbarium specimens from supposed wild subpopulations are known but it seems that the species was once present on islands in the Bay of Islands, on Limestone Island, Whangarei and from Motukaraka / Flat Island near Auckland. Many literature records are not supported with herbarium specimens leaving it unclear if Clianthus puniceus or C. magnificus was present, or indeed if the records were from garden plants or genuinely wild occurrences.","This species is occasionally cultivated both in Aotearoa / New Zealand and internationally. Most plants sold by nurseries are Clianthus magnificus, usually marketed as C. puniceus ‘Kaka King’ or C. maximus ‘Kaka King’. A white-flowered race is also known. When Clianthus magnificus became commercially available it rapidly supplanted C. puniceus as the latest ‘fad’ plant, and now genuine C. puniceus is rarely seen in cultivation or for sale.",Terrestrial,"Clianthus puniceus is a taonga (treasure) to Auckland and Northland iwi. As such, some iwi have nurseries growing the species and there have been attempted plantings on Motuarohia (Bay of Islands), Limestone Island (Whangarei Harbour), Tiritirimatangi and Motuihe islands (Hauraki Gulf). Plantings have also been made on restoration land managed by the New Zealand Forest Restoration Trust along the south-western shore of the Kaipara Harbour. All these plantings have used Moturemu Island plants and so represent one lineage only. It has been suggested that efforts are made to secure seed from cultivated C. puniceus worldwide on the assumption that these may add to the existing genetic diversity because they may represent provenances that have died out in Aotearoa / New Zealand. Despite plantings, without regular weeding and control of browsing animals, including introduced slugs and snails, plants are rarely persistent. Natural recruitment from plantings has yet to be observed. As with Clianthus magnificus, hand clearing of competing weeds and spraying of plants for insect pests and diseases, as well as using sprays to deter browsing animals could be used to maintain and enhance plantings.New Zealand Threat Classification System assessed this species as ‘Threatened / Nationally Critical’ Qualified ‘CD’ [Conservation Dependent], ‘EW’ [Extinct in the Wild] (de Lange et al. 2018).",Australasian,2015,false,false,Global

The species was first recorded in 1719 by Kolbe, and was described by Pallas in 1766 (Klein 1974) from material of uncertain provenance (Rookmaaker 1989). Its historical distribution is thus based on few records, of which only two can be considered to be reasonably precise (Kerley et al. 2009): Thunberg on 20 January 1774 and Le Vaillant in March/April 1783. An additional record in 1783 provided by Sparrman (1786) much further east at Krakeel River in the Langkloof may reflect a transported skin, given that this location is hundreds of kilometres east of other records. However, although the recent historical range is thought to be bounded by the locations of the Caledon, Swellendam and Bredasdorp, in the Western Cape (Skead 1980, Rookmaaker 1989), archaeological evidence suggests a previously much wider distribution: early in the Last Glacial (70,000–35,000 years before present (ybp)) it occurred on the grasslands of the Cape lowlands, south of the Cape Folded Belt from present day Grahamstown (farm ‘‘Uniondale’’) in the east to the vicinity of Saldanha Bay in the West. A similar distribution has been inferred for the early (ca 10,000 ybp) Holocene (Klein 1974, Cruz-Uribe et al. 2003). During the late Pleistocene (18,000–10,000 ybp), analysis of rock paintings reveal that the species occurred as far north as the eastern parts of South Africa’s Free State Province (Loubser et al. 1990, Plug and Engela 1992, Plug and Badenhorst 2001).","",Terrestrial,This species is now Extinct.,Afrotropical,1799-1800,false,false,Global

Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides. The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden et al. 2013, Wicaksono et al. 2017, Lyra et al. 2017, Neate-Clegg et al. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds et al. 2006, Blaustein et al. 2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). Mapance NGO have conducted monthly biodiversity surveys since 2015, surveying from the visitor centre up the mountain which includes the second site that this species is known from for which there have been no records (H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).  Furthermore, in 2017 and 2018 survey work was conducted in Volcan Pacayita, which is the only adjacent area with suitable habitat for the species; and no records of the species were found (F. Castañeda pers. comm. March 2019). The last verified sighting was in 1987 at the type locality, and in 1990 in Rio Arcaqual (Wilson and McCranie 2002). Given that there have been no records since 1990, despite extensive surveys in suitable habitat, it is likely that this species is extinct (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019).","","This species was only known from two sites in the Montana de Celaque, Departments of Lempira and Ocotepeque, western Honduras, between 1,400-1,840 m asl.

It reproduced by direct development along streams.,"Habitat loss due to urbanisation and coffee farming is taking place in the region where this species was previously extant, which may have played a role in the the dramatic population decline. Some other species of Craugastor that are associated with streams have undergone dramatic declines and disappearances at higher elevations, possibly due to chytridiomycosis, which probably contributed to the extinction of this species (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).","It is known from 24 specimens. Formerly, it was moderately common, but has experienced a precipitous decline. It was last observed in 1974 by J. Lynch. A visit to the area of the type locality in 27 July 1996 failed to turn up individuals of this or any other amphibian and the area at that time was considerably more deforested than it was during 1974 (McCranie and Wilson 2002). Apparently the small stream where Lynch collected the type series had presumably long since dried up as a result of the continued deforestation of the steep montane slopes in the vicinity of the type locality (McCranie and Wilson 2002). There have been many efforts to locate this species since its apparent disappearance. For example, surveys between 2016-2018 have been conducted at the vicinity of the type locality at least 10 times and did not recorded the species, but recorded other species of Craugastor (L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019).In addition to the habitat devastation having taken place in the vicinity of its type locality, the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was reported in some frogs at a higher elevation site (1,690 m asl) from the Sierra de Omoa in northwestern Honduras by Kolby et al.

118976576,54583,Anaxyrus baxteri,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2020-06-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct in the Wild because this species is believed to have become extinct following declines in the 1960s and 1970s. Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green et al. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to Bd, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% Bd positive rates in tested toads (Polasik et al. 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik et al. 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002, 2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik et al. 2015). As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).","","This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km2 of the Laramie Basin. It was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). In 1987, a small remnant population was discovered at Mortenson Lake (Stone 1991). In 1989, all remaining wild individuals from Mortenson Lake were taken into captivity, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015). It is known from an elevation of 2,164 m asl (Green et al. 2014).",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceThis species occurs within the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which encompasses four impoundments: Mortenson, Garber, Gibbs, and Soda lakes.

Efforts are being made to establish additional suitable release sites on public lands and private lands protected through Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2002). Bd (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) surveillance and research is ongoing to understand disease dynamics in both the wild and captive population of Wyoming toads. This species is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation NeededIt is recommended that for occupied lakes, emergent and bank vegetation (bulrushes, sedges, grasses, etc.) be managed through grazing, prescribed burning, and mechanical removal, etc. to prevent overgrown vegetation that inhibits the free movement of toads and could potentially alter the thermal environment.

Therefore, this species is assessed as Extinct in the Wild (EW).","This gregarious, thermophilic species inhabited a small (maximum recorded surface area c. 600 m2), shallow (maximum depth &lt; 2 metres) lake fed by a sublacustrine geothermal spring. Under natural conditions the mean annual water temperature in the lake was 29.1°C, but it became progressively colder after the 1960s as a result of the spring's discharge falling from 500 litres/second to 50 litres/second prior to the turn of the century (see 'Threats'). A number of additional springs and two other small lakes in the vicinity are also connected to the Peța River, but this species has not been recorded in any of them.The lake was heavily-vegetated and supported two other endemic taxa, comprising the melanopsid gastropod Microcolpia parreyssii, which has been globally extinct since the mid-2010s, and water lily subspecies Nymphaea lotus var. thermalis, small numbers of which survive at several other locations in the Peța River system.Racovitza's Rudd is omnivorous and feeds on aquatic invertebrates and algae, supplemented by smaller amounts of higher plant material.The annual reproductive period extends from February to March, and the eggs are deposited among submerged vegetation.","This species' extinction in the wild was caused by continued decline in the extent and quality of habitat over a period of several decades, culminating in the drying of Lake Pețea during September 2014.The primary driver of these events is understood to have been excessive abstraction of groundwater from the geothermal aquifer which feeds the Peța River. This water is partially utilised to heat local homes and guest houses, but also to supply business establishments associated with the wellness, recreational and therapeutic uses of the thermal waters, which are considered to have special properties due to the minerals they contain. The first dedicated tourist facilities were constructed during the 1970s, and extensive investment in new infrastructure during the 2000s prompted a shift from wellness to recreational tourism.The natural discharge of the geothermal aquifer began to decline after several artesian wells became operational during the 1980s, which caused some smaller springs to dry out. By the mid-2000s, water was being legally abstracted from 29 individual sites, while an undetermined number of illicit boreholes supplying private residences had also been drilled.Non-native fish taxa introduced to the Peța River include Topmouth Gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), Brown Bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and a number of ornamental species that were presumably released by aquarists. The presence of these is likely to have increased resource competition and predation pressure on the Racovitza's Rudd population.Moreover, the cooling water temperatures plausibly impacted recruitment by disrupting physiological processes associated with reproduction and altering the structure of planktonic and zoobenthic communities in the lake. Foraging and reproductive success may have been further compromised by agricultural (nutrients, pesticides and sediments) and domestic (garbage and wastewater) pollution from an affluent stream, which led to increased eutrophication, siltation and the development of a thick organic substrate layer due to overgrowth of the invasive plants Ceratopteris thalictroides, Bacopa sp. and Elodea sp..The population size of Racovitza's Rudd is thus believed to have been somewhat reduced prior to dewatering of the lake, which took place over a period of several years. The sublacustrine source spring first became inactive during December 2011, when a sudden decline in depth and surface area was observed. Flow was briefly reestablished in spring 2012, but by the end of that year the lake had been reduced to a small pond measuring a few metres in diameter which was maintained only by intermittent pumping of water from a nearby borehole. These conditions were exacerbated by a series of consecutive dry summers, and in September 2014 the lake completely dried out. This pattern has been repeated in subsequent years, with active groundwater discharge restricted to a short period each spring. By 2017, the number of operational extraction wells had fallen by more than half, indicating severe depletion of the geothermal aquifer.","This species' wild population became extinct in September 2014, following an extended period of declining habitat quality (see 'Threats'). A number of ex situ subpopulations are currently established (see 'Conservation').","","This species was endemic to a single small lake fed by a geothermal spring in the vicinity of Oradea, Bihor County, northwestern Romania. The lake, known locally as Pețea or Ochiul Mare, is located in the upper reaches of the Peța River, a minor left-bank tributary of the Crișul Repede (hu. Sebes-Körös) River in the upper Tisza River system. The Tisza is itself a major affluent of the Danube River.",This species is not used or traded.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is included in Appendix III of the Bern Convention (as Rutilus racovitzai).Lake Pețea and the surrounding area lie within the boundaries of a protected area created in 1932, which was added to the European Union's Natura 2000 network in 2007 (site ROSCI0098). Racovitza's Rudd is not listed as a target species.In 2012, fears over deteriorating habitat quality resulted in 60 individuals, comprising 58 females and 2 males, being collected from the wild and transferred to the Țării Crișurilor Museum in Oradea with the aid of financial support from the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. Some of these individuals were later transferred to the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE, formerly Szent István University) in Budapest, Hungary, where reproduction was artificially induced. Around 5,000 individuals were successfully reared as a result of these efforts, which were split between several institutions in order to establish multiple ex situ subpopulations. As of early 2024, stocks are maintained at the Țării Crișurilor Museum (Oradea, Romania), Răsvan Angheluțăq Museum of Natural Sciences (Galați, Romania), MATE, Schönbrunn Zoo (Vienna, Austria), Plzeň Zoo (Plzeň, Czechia) and Tropicarium (Budapest, Hungary).The Lake Pețea ecosystem and its endemic fauna and flora were targeted by the 'Conservation and protection of ecosystems endangered by lack of thermal and freshwater in crossborder area' project, which took place from 2018-2021 and was co-funded by the European Union within the Interreg Europe interregional cooperation programme (project code ROHU-29). A series of useful studies and conservation activities were completed through a collaboration between the Oradea Metropolitan Development Association, University of Oradea, Aqua Crisius Angling Association and the HUN-REN Institute for Nuclear Research (Debrecen, Hungary), although none of them resulted in long-term outcomes for Racovitza's Rudd.The reestablishment of this species in the wild is currently precluded by a lack of stable hydrological conditions at the former Lake Pețea, the restoration of which should be treated as a conservation priority. The development of sustainable water abstraction protocols is likely to represent the most effective initial management strategy. If the lake's water level can be restored, a period of monitoring should ideally be implemented in order to assess its ecological status prior to any direct reintroduction efforts.",Palearctic,2014,false,false,Global & Europe

Recent fieldwork at the type locality did not find this species and most potential habitats in the area surrounding the type locality (near Palmarin) have been destroyed by local salt mining. This species is, therefore, assessed as Extinct.","Although most of the habitats are brackish at the estuary of Saloum river, there are some inundated freshwater pools, which are separated from flooded saline habitats by clay layer. As species in the genus Eriocaulon do not prefer saline habitats, this species might have occurred in these inundated pools.","There is extensive ongoing salt mining by locals at the type locality, which destroys the natural habitats at the estuary of Saloum river. Increasing occurrence of droughts also threatens the remaining freshwater pools.","The type locality was visited in 2014, but the species was not found (A. Mesterházy pers. obs. 2014).

The Anse Quitor tree has been fenced at the request of the private landowner but is not producing viable fruits. In effect, the species is classed as 'extinct in the wild', sensu IUCN. This is a continuation from Strahm (1989), who stated that Dombeya rodriguesiana was 'possibly rare over a century, today this species is almost extinct in the wild and only clones of the male from Grande Montagne are in cultivation'.","Dombeya rodriguesiana appears to be able to grow at all elevations on Rodrigues, both on calcarenite and basalt, based on current and past information on distribution (Grande Montagne, Saint d'Or, Vainquer, Mont Bourne, Cascade Mourouk, Cascade Victoire, Grande Caverne, Plaine Corail).  In 2019, there was a single wild individual growing outside the Anse Quitor Nature Reserve on calcarenite.  Remy in 1956 recorded the species at 218 m altitude surrounded by Cassine orientalis, Dracaena reflexa and Litsea glutinosa.  The Grande Montagne tree was solitary in a low, partly native thicket, as was the individual in Vainquer.  Both were growing on a rocky slope among boulders (Strahm 1989).  It is thought to be the most xerophyllous Dombeya of the Mascarenes.Flowering has been recorded from May to August while young, medium greenish fruits were seen in October and fruits in November and January. The wood is extremely hard (Strahm 1989).","Known threats to the species include subsistence level wood harvesting in the past, as well as collection to make pipes. Grazing by cattle may also have affected the species. Currently, the single wild individual is not producing viable fruits. Cloning from individuals in the past has been limited in success.","In 2020, there was a single wild individual growing outside the Anse Quitor Nature Reserve on calcarenite.  This individual was discovered on an animal farm in 2008 and has been fenced to protect it from grazers. This 2.5 m tree flowers and produces fruits each year.  However, since there are only female plants known, the fruits are not viable, so the plant does not constitute a viable population. Clones of male Grande Montagne tree (which died in 1983) were produced, but none were successful from the last female plant from Plaine Corail (which died soon after 1976).  A tree in Saint D'Or had been cut down by 1984.

184207893,44080,Brighamia insignis,Extinct in the Wild,,2023,2022-08-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Brighamia insignis is assessed as Extinct in the Wild under criterion D. NTBG Senior Research Biologist Ken Wood saw the last remaining wild individual in Hoʻolulu Valley on the Nā Pali coast of Kauaʻi by helicopter on 29 August 2012. On 24 June 2019 and 20 May 2020, drone survey work was conducted in that same location and surrounding area which confirmed that last known wild individual is no longer present.","The taxon is a succulent, typically unbranched shrub historically endemic to the westernmost main Hawaiian Islands of Kaua‘i and Ni‘ihau where it occurred on sea cliffs and coastal bluffs between sea level and 400 m elevation. Associated native plant species included Artemisia australis, Bidens forbesii, Eragrostis variabilis, Euphorbia spp., Hibiscus kokio subsp. saintjohnianus, Pandanus tectorius, Polyscias racemosa, and Psydrax odorata.","Major threats that contributed to the decline of this taxon in the wild included predation and habitat degradation by non-native animals, particularly goats that eat the plants and increase landslides in the natural cliff side habitat. Non-native, invasive plant taxa, such as Ficus sp., Lantana camara, Melinis sp., Psidium cattleianum, Schinus terebinthifolius, Syzygium cumini, continuously contribute to the displacement of native habitat for possible recruitment of Brighamia insignis. A severe lack of pollination occurring combined with predominately self-incompatibility, is also a major factor to the decline of this taxon. The loss of its pollinator(s) is suspected; this is believed to have been a hawkmoth based on the species floral biology (Walsh et al. 2019). In addition, Fortini et al. (2013) characterized this taxon as extremely vulnerable to climate change (vulnerability index 0.867). Hurricanes are a major threat; Hurricane Iniki in 1992 wiped out populations that remained on the southeastern part of Kauaʻi.",Brighamia insignis was realized to be extinct in the wild in 2020 after numerous drone surveys confirmed the last known individual was no longer present.,"","This species was historically endemic to the Hawaiian islands of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau. On Kauaʻi, it was formerly found along the length of the island's north Nā Pali coast and in the southeast part of the island in the Haʻupu Mountain range. The last known wild individual occurred in Hoʻolulu Valley at 152 m elevation on the Nā Pali coast.","This taxon has been extremely popular for decades in the plant trade all over the world, both in botanic gardens and homes. In 1977 and 1978, then National Tropical Botanical Garden field botanist Steve Perlman collected seeds from the Waiahuakua population on the Nā Pali coast and distributed them to various botanical gardens around the world (Hannon and Perlman 2002). In the early 2000s in the Netherlands, Plant Planet cultivated and sold Brighamia insignis by the hundreds of thousands (Robin Schaap, Plant Planet Manager, pers. comm., February 2013). The following was reported in NTBG's Tropical Plant Database: Raw parts of the plants were eaten by early Hawaiians to treat consumption and other disorders (Degener, O. 1930. Ferns and Flowering Plants of Hawaii National Park). Crushed leaves mixed with sea salt are used to treat cuts and infections (R. Kanahele pers. comm. 2003).",Terrestrial,"Brighamia insignis has been listed as Endangered on the U.S. Endangered Species List since 1994, and also on the State of Hawaiʻi Endangered Species List. With less than 50 individuals remaining in the wild for many years, it has also been a focus of the Hawaiʻi State Plant Extinction Prevention Program. Conservation collections, ex ­situ cultivation, propagule storage and applied research to inform best management practices has been ongoing at the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG), as well as other institutions locally, nationally, and internationally. NTBG has outplanted hundreds B. insignis individuals at the Limahuli Garden and Preserve on the north shore of Kaua‘i. These plantings started in the living collection or lower garden portion in 1992 and in the Limahuli Lower Preserve in 2006 (Kava Vale, pers. comm., January 2015). Outplantings were also done at the Kīlauea Point National Wildlife Refuge on the northeast coast of Kaua‘i by the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) and volunteers in 1995 (Jennifer Waipa, pers. comm., January 2015). The Kīlauea Point outplanting, however, was not self-sustaining and all of those planted have since died (Kim Uyehara, pers. comm., April 2013). None of the outplantings have ever produced viable offspring without intense human intervention (without collection of seeds, which were likely the result of hand pollination, and propagation in a nursery). Results of an ex situ genetic diversity study have informed controlled crosses to increase heterosis, spearheaded by NTBG and Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG) (Walsh, 2015; Wood et al., 2020; Foster et al., 2022). Large outplantings have recently been done in NTBG's Limahuli and McBryde gardens to expand NTBG's ex situ living collection and they were set-up experimentally to investigate whether there is higher survivorship and fitness in progeny from more diverse crosses as informed by molecular work.

209512755,103823664,Hemignathus affinis,Extinct,,2024,2024-02-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that the species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.94, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.91. Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, H. affinis was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","Hemignathus affinis inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000 m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott et al. 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to H. hanapepe in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Conant et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 1995). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for H. affinis and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa Akialoa lanaiensis, that occupied somewhat similar niches to H. affinis, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.","After no sightings for more than 60 years, Hemignathus affinis was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of Chlorodrepanis virens and possibly Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.91, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct. In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. affinis from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","","Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that H. affinis was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where G. floridana was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover G. floridana have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann et al. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by Thompson et al. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the  Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable. See attached Supplementary Information document for further details.",Govenia floridana is a terrestrial orchid that grew in deep hummus on the forest floor of heavily shaded tropical hardwood hammock habitat in Everglades National Park. It was reported to flower between November and December (Luer 1972).,"Poaching and trampling of the site by collectors may have contributed to this orchid’s decline and eventual disappearance from its only known locality (Gann 2015). In 1960 Hurricane Donna significantly altered conditions in the single hardwood hammock where this species occurred, increasing light penetration to the forest floor and causing an increase in understory vegetation. Altered conditions did not appear to have an immediate impact on the population of Govenia floridana, but may have contributed to its decline (Luer 1972). Long Pine Key, where this orchid was located, is protected within Everglades National Park. However, development and habitat degradation in South Florida has resulted in the loss of most potentially suitable hardwood hammock habitat outside the park (Loope and Avery 1979). ","When discovered in 1957, the only known population of Govenia floridana consisted of 25 individuals. When the last verified record of this species was made in 1964, the population consisted of fewer than 10 individuals.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone 2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996). A recent five-day survey of Santa Luzia failed to recover evidence of a surviving population (Miralles et al. 2011, Vasconcelos et al. 2013), and these authors likewise concluded that this skink is now extinct. The most recent record of this species was a mandible of a juvenile collected from cat faeces on Santa Luzia in 2005, since when the cat population has increased and the invasive animals are now widespread on the island (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). Repeated surveys of Branco and Raso since this species was last recorded have also failed to rediscover it.","","This species was endemic to the Cape Verde islands, where it had been recorded from the islets Branco and Raso (Schleich 1987, Bocage 1873). These islands have a combined area less than 10.7 km². Its area of occupancy would have been an estimated 7 km² (Vasconcelos et al. 2013). It appears to have historically been more widespread on the islands (Bocage 1873), with subfossils reported from São Vicente and Santa Luzia (Mateo et al. 1997). It may also have occurred on São Nicolau, based on the reports of local fishermen, but evidence for this is lacking (Miralles et al. 2011). Mateo et al. (2005) reported finding partial remains of a juvenile in cat faeces on Santa Luzia, but a five-day survey of this island in 2006 failed to record the species (Miralles et al. 2011, Vasconcelos et al. 2013). Additional subfossil remains have been found near a beach on this island (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012).","Use of this species has been reported for local subsistence hunting, for medicine (as a traditional painkiller - Bocage 1873), and for the international pet trade. It was also harvested for its skin, which was used to make shoes (Bocage 1873).",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are applicable for this skink, which has not been found in recent exhaustive surveys of its known sites and is presumed to be extinct.

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900 m, mainly 1,200-1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger et al. 2020). Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie Freycinetia arborea, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger et al. 1998).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats, primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source, ‘ie‘ie vine Freycinetia arborea (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of Culex will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, have not been seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022).","There have been unconfirmed reports of Ou up to 1996, but no confirmed records since 1989. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.984, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.941. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. Historically Ou were widespread across much of the Hawaiian Archipelago, but were extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). The last confirmed record on Hawai'i was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998) while the last confirmed record on Kauai was 1989 (Pyle 1986).","","Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J.
