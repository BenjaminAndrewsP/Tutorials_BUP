However, several individuals showing hybridization between &#160;<em>C. niger</em>&#160; and &#160;<em>C. becki</em>&#160;have recently been discovered on Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela, as well as some with partial ancestry from other islands, including Española and a few from southern Isabela, and some in captivity&#160;at the&#160;Galápagos National Park’s Tortoise Center&#160;on Santa Cruz Island, probably as a result of&#160;<em>C. niger</em>&#160;being released on Isabela by whalers or other mariners prior to the 1830s (as with&#160;<em>C.</em>&#160;<em>abingdonii</em>), suggesting that the taxon’s genome may not yet be fully extirpated (Poulakakis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Russello <em>et al</em>. 2010, Garrick <em>et al</em>. 2012, TEWG 2015).

Schwatrz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century is a more probable explanation.","Surrounded by cliffs, the portions of Navassa Island presumably capable of supporting iguanas prior to their extinction was characterized by Ekman (1929), Proctor (1959), and paraphrased in Powell (1999). The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (<em>Ficus populnea </em>var. <em>brevifolia</em>)<em>, </em>False Mastic (<em>Sideroxylon foetidissimum</em>)<em>, </em>Pigeon Plum (<em>Coccoloba diversifolia</em>)<em>, </em>and Poisonwood (<em>Metopium brownei</em>). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.<br/><br/>Among the five specimens&#160;known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000).

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,Extinct,,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The red alga <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world).  The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855.  This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels.  The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships.  This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988.  Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until  23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site.  No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus <em>Sargassum</em>, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions. <br/><br/>The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour).  This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886.  This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since.  The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic.  The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp <em>Ecklonia radiata</em> and the green alga <em>Caulerpa filiformis</em> growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions.  No specimens of <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> have been discovered. <br/><br/>Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline.  Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus <em>Vanvoorstia</em>, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> belongs, such areas should harbor this species.  In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [<em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em>] either cast up or by dredging.""  He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936.  The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position.  She was also unable to rediscover this species. <br/><br/>Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of  a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast.  Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between.  The red algal species <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has not been discovered during any of these dives. <br/><br/>Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations.  This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce.  There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable.  In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters. <br/><br/>The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that  the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886.  The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores.  Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it  was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the  North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement  in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued  rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some  streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North  Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas,  it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely  encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to  the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not  noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn  and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again  in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a  variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The  roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of  factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration  of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover  resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature  and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species&#160;was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. Hector (1871) reported of immense and conspicuous shoals ascending the Hutt River (southern North Island) in January. Apparently, however, signs of decreasing numbers were evident soon afterwards. The disappearance of the fish from the Waikato River (North Island) was noted to have occurred in 1874. In 1878, Rutland (who studied the species in the Nelson and Marlborough district, South Island), noted that in the Maitai River (n the north of the South Island) it had 'become very scarce during the past three years'. This disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island.

The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be established some time in the near future. When that happens, its Red List status will need to be reassessed.","Studies have been carried out on the behaviour, ecology and reproduction of Père David’s Deer in Beijing since 1985, in Dafeng since 1986, and in Shishou since 2001. This species lives in low-lying grasslands and reed beds, often in seasonally flooded areas such as the lower Yangtze River valley and coastal marshes.  It eats grass, reeds and leaves of bushes, can swim well, and spend long periods in water.  It lives in single sex ormaternal herds. Animals reach maturity during second year. Gestation is 270-300 days. One, rarely two young are born. These are weaned in 10-11 months.  Adults live up to 18 years. Data from the Dafeng Reserve suggests that female <em>E. davidianus</em> establish a home range of approximately 1 km² (Hu and Jiang 2002).","The species became extinct in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting.  The size of the reintroduced population was only 120 in 1993 (Cao 1993), although has increased to over 2,000 since that time (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). Low genetic diversity has been identified as a long-term threat by Zeng <em>et al</em>. (2007) and Yang <em>et al</em>. (2008). It is unclear how much native habitat remains on which <em>E. davidianus</em> can exist in a free-ranging state.","After decades of <em>ex situ</em> conservation, the species breeds successfully in captivity (Beck and Wemmer 1983). In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. <br/><br/>The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000a).<br/><br/>The second re-introduction of <em>E. davidianus</em> was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000b). <br/><br/>The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000b). <br/><br/><em>E. davidianus</em> from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 <em>E. davidianus</em> in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. <br/><br/>In November, 2002, 30 <em>E. davidianus</em> (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). <br/><br/>Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of <em>E. davidianus</em> in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed <em>E. davidianus</em> herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. <br/><br/>There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.",,"This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. <br/><br/>Fossils of <em>Elaphurus bifurcatus</em>, <em>E. chinanensis chia</em>, <em>E. lantianensis</em> have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of <em>Elaphurus</em>, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, <em>P. davidianus</em> was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of <em>P. davidianus</em> shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). <em>P. davidianus</em> is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.<br/><br/>During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of <em>P. davidianus</em> in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” <em>P. davidianus</em> in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.<br/><br/>However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52). Nevertheless, the heavily inbred Père David’s Deer safely passed though the genetic bottleneck of inbreeding and adopted the vast open parkland of an English country estate (Jones <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1983).<br/><br/>The captive population started to increase (though with a setback during the First World War due to food shortage), and since the Second World War, the animals started to be spread through captive facilities worldwide, with the first captive animals being sent back to Beijing Zoo in 1956.",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is listed on the Chinese Red List as Extinct in the Wild, and on the China Key List - I. <br/><br/>Recommended conservation action includes:<br/>1.

Turvey <em>et al.</em> (2006) assessed whether hunting alone would have been sufficient to wipe out the sea cow, and showed that the speed of sea cow disappearance on Bering Island indicates that hunting alone was more than sufficient to exterminate the species without having to invoke any additional ecological pressures.&#160;Conversely, Estes <em>et al.</em> (2015) argued that hunting of sea otters alone could account for the sea cows’ extinction.

Their diet is unknown, but may have included eels, lobsters, octopus, and reef fish. Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land, and its lack of fear of humans and an unaggressive and curious nature contributed to its demise. They were medium-sized seals, with adult standard lengths of 200-240 cm (Allen 2004). Very little is known about the natural history of&#160; the Caribbean Monk Seal, but related species mature at 4-8 years old, give birth to a single pup (usually annually), and can live to be more than 20 years old.","The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).","Caribbean Monk Seals were first discovered by Columbus in 1494, and early records testify to its abundance in several parts of the Caribbean. Population size prior to exploitation has been estimated as 233,000-338,000 (McClenachan and Cooper 2007). Hunting of Caribbean Monk Seals by Europeans for food began with Columbus, and many animals were killed for that reason over the following centuries. In the late 1600s hundreds of seals were killed primarily to be used for oil to lubricate machinery on sugar plantations. Additional animals were taken for public display and killed for museum specimens and other reasons (Hairr 2011). By the late 1880s the species was rare, though the Triangle Keys west of Yucatan remained a stronghold of the species until 1915 when about 200 animals were killed there (<a href=""http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/"">The Sixth Extinction Website</a> 2007). The last reliable record from anywhere was of a small colony at Seranilla Bank, a group of tiny coral islands halfway between Jamaica and Honduras, in 1952 (Adams 2004). An aerial survey in 1973 covering much of the species known range did not produce any seal sightings (Kenyon 1977). Vessel surveys of the region in 1980 (Sergeant et al. 1980) and 1984 (LeBoeuf et al. 1986) also&#160; failed to locate any seals. Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean Monk Seals by local fishermen and divers (see for example Boyd and Stanfield (1998)) almost certainly refer to wandering Hooded Seals that have been positively identified on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2001).",,"The Caribbean Monk Seal inhabited primarily the Caribbean Sea, northwest to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It had been recorded from numerous islands reefs and cays, including the Bahamas and Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Yucatan Peninsula and southeast along the Central and South American coasts as far east as Guyana. The northernmost extralimital record is from Georgia in the southeastern United States (Allen 2004).

The species was first recorded in 1719 by Kolbe, and was described by Pallas in 1766 (Klein 1974) from material of uncertain provenance (Rookmaaker 1989). Its historical distribution is thus based on few records, of which only two can be considered to be reasonably precise (Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2009): Thunberg on 20 January 1774 and Le Vaillant in March/April 1783. An additional record in 1783 provided by Sparrman (1786) much further east at Krakeel River in the Langkloof may reflect a transported skin, given that this location is hundreds of kilometres east of other records. However, although the recent historical range is thought to be bounded by the locations of the Caledon, Swellendam and Bredasdorp, in the Western Cape (Skead 1980, Rookmaaker 1989), archaeological evidence suggests a previously much wider distribution: early in the Last Glacial (70,000–35,000 years before present (ybp)) it occurred on the grasslands of the Cape lowlands, south of the Cape Folded Belt from present day Grahamstown (farm ‘‘Uniondale’’) in the east to the vicinity of Saldanha Bay in the West.

There are widely scattered occurrences in cultivation, sometimes in more seasonal areas, and sometimes at up to ca. 2000 m, across to the Pacific slopes of the Andes.&#160;<br/><br/>The elevation range within the putative native range of the species is 100-600 m.","As with all other species of <em>Brugmansia</em>, there are no records at all of wild populations of <em>B. insignis</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>The absence of wild plants was first recorded (albeit in relation to other <em>Brugmansia </em>species) by Ruiz &amp; Pavón in the late 18th Century (Schultes and von Thene de Jamarillo-Arango 1998: 114). Later, in spite of decades of field work in NW South America, R.E. Schultes and his students Lockwood and Bristol, who specialized in this genus and other neotropical psychoactive plants, recorded finding no wild brugmansias at all (Bristol 1966, Lockwood 1973). Recent examination by Hay of numerous herbarium collections has turned up no specimens collected from the wild (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2012: 172).<br/><br/>While it is valued by those who know well how to use it both medicinally and as an entheogen, it is feared for its toxicity and superstitions about its 'evil' nature by those who do not, and it is anecdotally reported as being eradicated from gardens, sometimes at the behest of local authorities in response to the use of scopolamine for criminal purposes.<br/><br/>Loss of interest in cultivating this species, through loss of traditional healing skills, as well as active steps to eradicate it in places are the principal and current threats, as with other <em>Brugmansia </em>species.","Since this genus survives only in cultivation, its wild population is zero. There are anecdotal views expressed by some indigenous healers that plants of this (and other) <em>Brugmansia </em>species are being eradicated from some indigenous gardens due to its toxicity and the declining numbers of healers expert enough to use it safely. However, there are no quantitative data regarding this.",,"Defining a native geographic range for this species is speculative.&#160;<br/><br/>Lockwood (1973) formed the view that, despite the exclusive association of Brugmansias with human habitation, native distributions of the species could be defined and recognized by the presence of intraspecific variability and high levels of fruit set, in contrast to low variability and low or absent fruit set in clones taken outside their native range.<br/><br/>However, <em>Brugmansia insignis</em>, while exhibiting high variability, rarely sets fruit for reasons that are unclear (though artificial hybridization demonstrates it is fertile). Hay <em>et al.</em> (2012: 94) mapped a putative native distribution based largely on the distribution of indigenous groups who make exclusive use of this <em>Brugmansia </em>species and who cultivate a range of several varieties: the eastern Andean foothills of western Amazonia from Colombia to Bolivia. It has also been recorded in the Colombian Dept. of Meta in the Orinoco drainage.<br/><br/>There are scattered occurrences, almost always of single clones, in gardens well to the west of this putative native range, including wet areas of the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. One particular site of note is Santo Domingo de los Colorados, Ecuador, where is it quite commonly cultivated and used by the Tsáchila.","There is a very wide range of medicinal and spiritual uses among the indigenous people who cultivate it, with various forms (≃cultivars) recognized (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2012: 22-73). It is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant, but it is seldom seen in cultivation outside its presumed native range, and is virtually absent from cultivation outside of tropical South America.<br/><br/>As with the rest of this genus, its usefulness, far from being a threat, appears to be what has allowed it to avoid complete extinction.",Terrestrial,"The complete absence of wild plants suggests, as with other <em>Brugmansia </em>species, that the disperser(s) is/are extinct. The continued existence of this species within its presumed native range is currently dependent on its being cultivated by indigenous people.&#160;<br/><br/>Its ongoing survival appears dependent on maintenance or rehabilitation of cultural traditions in which it is used. Education about its cultural and practical value, as well as its precarious conservation status seem essential to counteract the negativity with which these plants are often seen.

Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J.

Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct.

In the late 20th century, the population declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. The population now appears to be Extinct in the Wild, as there is no evidence for natural reproduction any more, and no mature fish have been caught within the last 10 years.","Yangtze Sturgeon permanently lives in freshwater. It usually inhabits the upper and middle reaches of the river (it may also have entered the upper estuary of the Yangtze River). This species spawns in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–December). Its key spawning reach was between Maoshui and Hejiang, a stretch of 321.7 km (Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).","Historically, this species experienced unsustainable levels of fishing. Furthermore, mesh sizes of fishing nets have been reduced, thereby capturing young sturgeon, especially during the periods when many juveniles concentrate to feed. Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night.<br/> <br/> The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May. This is also the spawning season for <em>Acipenser dabryanus</em>, therefore spawning stocks were particularly vulnerable to capture.<br/> <br/>The construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981 and the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 have also caused major adverse effects to the habitat of this species and, prior to the wild population disappearing, these constructions caused the population to be restricted to the upstream river, above the dams. The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river.<br/> <br/> Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin. Much untreated waste water discharges into the river each year. Water quality is also affected by run-off caused by deforestation of the upper Yangtze Valley (Zhuang <em>et al</em>. 1997). Pollution has been declining regionally in recent years.","There seems to be no natural reproduction of this species any more, and there are no mature individuals of wild origin due to heavy overfishing. Historically, this was an important species in commercial fisheries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007). In the late 20th century, population numbers declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catch data between 1982 and 2019 indicate that since 2008, hundreds of individuals are being captured annually, all originating from releases (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). The species is now fully ranched, and no natural reproduction or natural population is documented in the wild. Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful. Since 2018, mature individuals have also been stocked. This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.",,"This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system. Historically, under the natural, unaltered conditions that existed until the middle of the 20th century, this species inhabited the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its large tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, Jialing, Xiang and Han rivers, as well as the large lakes attached to the Yangtze River.<br/> <br/> <em>Acipenser dabryanus</em> had been extirpated from the lower river, possibly since 1995, and it was restricted to the upper main stream of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Province (Zhuang <em>et al</em>. 1997). Starting in 2007, the conservation release programme was carried out in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, this fish can be found in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the confluences with some tributaries. However, the majority of individuals observed in the river originate from large scale releases and reproduction of the species in the wild has not been confirmed for at least two decades (one generation length for this species is 30 years).","<em>Acipenser dabryanus</em> was caught intensively for human consumption until the  year 2000. Since 2000, sturgeons are only taken accidentally as  bycatch and were mostly released, however post-release survival was  low.

The second and third generation propagation were carried out successfully by the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute in 2013 and 2018, respectively. From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation. In 2018, around 40 mature individuals were released into the same waters.

Some cultivated specimens have been replanted in semi-wild situations since the 1980s, but little or no recruitment has been observed except at one site.<br/><br/>The species was listed as ‘Critically Endangered C2a(i); D’ by Cairns-Wicks (2003). The transfer of status to ‘Extinct in the Wild’ is the result of the death of the last surviving individuals in the wild.</p>","<p>She Cabbage is a small tree, though it may reach 9 m in height under favourable conditions. Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.<br/><br/>This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved<em> </em>as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.<br/><br/>Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months. There is considerable variation in seed viability between individuals which suggests a degree of self-incompatibility, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. The achenes possess a pappus and are dispersed by the wind, but at some sites the majority are consumed by introduced bird species.<br/><br/>The unusually soft wood is prone to rapid decay and is host to several species of endemic wood-boring invertebrates. This xylophagous fauna is still poorly-known and its degree of overlap with other hosts is unclear. At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: <em>Opogona</em> sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.</p>","<p>Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.<br/><br/>Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.<br/><br/>The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.</p>","<p>From the 20<sup>th</sup> Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known.&#160;In the 1950s&#160;Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.<br/><br/>A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.</p>",,"The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island.&#160;This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"<p>Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.<br/><br/>The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.<br/><br/>Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant. Here a thriving population has been created amongst mixed stands of endemics, with a graded-age structure. In this favourable habitat, plants naturally self-seed to a moderate degree despite patchy levels of viability, although none of the progeny has yet reached maturity (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).</p>",Afrotropical,2012,false,false,Global

67371983,30560,Trochetiopsis erythroxylon,Extinct in the Wild,,2016,2015-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last wild St Helena Redwood tree (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em><span class=""authorship"">) died in the 1950s. Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","<p>The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum </em><span class=""authorship"">(Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived&#160; of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.<br/><br/>Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood<em> </em>once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (<em>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</em> Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.</p>","Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.",,"The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.<br/><br/>Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between <em>T. erythroxylon</em> and the related Dwarf Ebony (<em>Trochetiopsis ebenus</em> Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to <em>T. erythroxylon</em> parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.<br/><br/>A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and&#160;periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.</p>",Afrotropical,1950s,false,false,Global

Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln. The exceptionally dense, black wood was potentially very valuable, but it seems likely that many of the remaining trees were carelessly harvested for crude timber or firewood, and the bark stripped as a tanning agent.","The last confirmed record was made by Banks and Solander in 1771 (Banks 1896). Roxburgh reported that a few plants survived until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century (see Beatston 1816), though it seems likely that he did not see them personally.",,"The Ebony Tree was formerly known from dry lowland valleys and hill slopes of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. Very few botanical records were made before the 19<sup>th</sup> Century when the island had already been severely degraded by deforestation and grazing. We thus know little about the original flora, particularly those species which disappeared during the early phase of human impact. However, since the Ebony Tree was economically important it received occasional mentions in historical documents, and clues to its presence can still be found today in the form of fragments of semi-fossilized wood which still litter some of the drier seaward slopes.<br/><br/>From these indications, it appears that the species inhabited lowland areas of St Helena, especially along the south coast. Records have been made from Sandy Bay, Asses’ Ears, Devil’s Hole, Manati Bay, near Egg Island and Horse Pasture. Other possible locations include The Barn, High Knoll and Ebony Plain, but these are subject to potential confusion with the related Dwarf Ebony.",Fragments of ebony wood are still collected today.

The population was extremely small for at least 120 years before the final tree died in 1994. Well under 1 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat remains along St Helena’s Central Ridge and this has been searched extensively by botanists over recent decades.,"<p>Based on existing evidence, it appears that this species was an inhabitant of cloud forest around St Helena’s highest altitudes (above 750 m). The 20<sup>th</sup> Century specimen at Mt Actaeon grew in Tree Fern thicket (Cronk 2002), but it is also likely to have occurred in more mixed vegetation with other upland trees on steep slopes below the ridge crest. As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em> (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (<em>Lachanodes arborea</em> (Roxb.) B.Nord.).<br/><br/>The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months. The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).</p>","<p>The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.<br/><br/>Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests. It is entirely possible that susceptibility to introduced fungal pathogens may have played a longer term role in the overall demise.</p>","<p>Intact fragments of St Helena Olive habitat probably persisted until the late 1800s, when Solander noted trees up to 30 foot high (approx. 9 m) (see Cronk 2002). A century later, only 12-15 trees remained, and these reputedly attained little more than half the former stature (Melliss 1875). When George Benjamin discovered a single specimen near Mt Actaeon* in 1977 the species had not been seen for many years. This proved to be the last known wild specimen in existence. It died in 1994 but seedlings and a cutting had been propagated from it, and a few cultivated individuals continued the line.

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). <br/><br/>Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species&#160;was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.<br/><br/>Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990).

In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b).

It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/><br/>Richard <em>et al.</em> (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).

It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al. </em>1993, Trenerry <em>et al.</em> 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019).

78447380,21529,Taudactylus acutirostris,Extinct,,2022,2021-02-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct because it has not been recorded in the wild since 1997, and extensive searches over the last 20 years have failed to locate this species. This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being relatively common to extinct in only five or so years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","The species was known to be a habitat specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001) occurring along small creeks in rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest (Liem and Hosmer 1973). The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger<em> et al. </em>1999, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).<br/><br/>Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards<em> et al.</em> 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero <em>et al.</em> 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero <em>et al.</em> 2002, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006). Apart from these two individuals, it&#160;has not been recorded during extensive searches of suitable, known sites from the previous range of this species between 1994 and 2004 (Hero and McDonald, personal communication in Schloegel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and more recent extensive surveys in the region have still failed to find any individuals and it is now believed that this species is extinct (Conrad Hoskin pers. comm. 2016, Gillespie <em>et al. </em>2020).",,"This Australian endemic species was widely distributed from Mount Graham to the Big Tableland, in&#160;northeast Queensland, at altitudes of 300–1,300 m asl (McDonald 1992).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place</em></strong><br/>Its historical range included&#160;Lumholtz, Wooroonooran, Daintree, Crater, Cedar Bay, and Tully Falls National Parks, as well as&#160;Qld&#160;Timber Reserve (165 Monkhouse),&#160;Lamb Range, Malbon Thompson Range, Herberton Range, Ravenshoe, Kirrama Range, Mt Fisher, Maalan, Mt Lewis, and Windsor State Forests (Tyler 1997).&#160;There was a captive-rearing programme run by the Melbourne Zoo and the Queensland Department of the Environment, that started in 1996.

This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being relatively common to extinct in only three or four years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","The species&#160;was associated with permanent and temporary watercourses in montane rainforests, tall open forest, notophyll vine forest and sclerophyll fern forest (Czechura and Ingram 1990). In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm <em>Archontophoenix cunninghamia</em>, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (<em>Lomandra longifolia</em>, <em>Carex neurochlamys</em>, <em>Elatostema reticulatum</em> and <em>Blechnum nudum</em>) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). <br/><br/>Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer <em>et al. </em>2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like <em>Rheobatrachus silus</em>, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). The species&#160;was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with <em>Lantana camara</em> or where the weeds <em>Baccharis halimifolia</em> and <em>Ageratina riparia</em> (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy <em>et al.</em> 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990).

None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.",,"<em>Rucervus schomburgki</em> was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.<br/><br/>Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures. The indication that a remnant population might still survive (Schroering 1995 and <em>in litt</em>. as reported in Grubb 2005, MacPhee and Flemming 1999) was followed up by investigation, independently by several people, of Phongsali province, Lao PDR, by field survey and interview. This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive. However, any future indication of its existence should be followed up carefully. If by chance the species does survive, legislation giving it the highest levels of protection (in whatever country it was found), and an assessment of specific conservation needs would be imperative.",Indomalayan,last captive 1938; last wild animal known in 1932,false,false,Global

The last individual was observed in 2003. Despite intense surveys, no remaining individuals have been detected and there is no chance that such a large and enigmatic species has survived unnoticed. Therefore, this species is now assessed as Extinct.<br/><p></p>","The Chinese Paddlefish was anadromous (spent at least part of its life in the estuary and the sea and migrated upriver to reproduce). The species occurred in the main stem of large rivers, staying usually in middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swimming into large lakes. Its spawning period was in March and April. Spawning sites were located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Available information also indicates that spawning took place in the lower Jinsha River between Shuifu and Yibin (Liu and Zeng 1988, Li <em>et al</em>. 1997). <br/><br/><em>Psephurus gladius</em> was a piscivorous species, and the largest individual recorded was 7 m in length and weighed over several thousand pounds.","The Chinese Paddlefish was heavily overfished. Even fry of <em>Psephurus gladius</em>, forming schools along the river, were easily captured in traditional Chinese fishing nets and set nets (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009). All age classes were taken whenever possible. Its long generation time (e.g. late sexual maturation and large size) made it very vulnerable to overharvest.<br/><br/>In 1981 the Gezhouba Dam was built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, blocking the migration route and preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn. Due to early depletion of the stocks and the difficulties to keep it in aquaculture, no ex situ population was established.","The species is now extinct (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2020). After the last finding of the species in 2003, the distribution area was surveyed intensively but without success and there have been also no reports or sightings from other waters. There is no hope that this large and enigmatic species might have survived unnoticed.<br/><br/>From the mid-20th century the population of the Chinese Paddlefish decreased rapidly. Incidental capture data between 1982–2003 from the upper, mid and lower sections of the Yangtze indicate the largest number was found in 1985, when 32 individuals were captured in the lower section (below the Gezhouba Dam) (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009). In 1995 juveniles were recorded below the Gezhouba Dam of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007).<br/><br/>Two juvenile individuals (1.2 kg weight, 47 cm total length; 1.3 kg weight, 50 cm total length) were still found in the Chongqing reach in 1992 (Chen 2007). In 2002, an adult female (body length 330 cm, weight 117 kg) was captured in the section of Jiangsu Nanjing of the Yangtze River. Urgent attempts were made to safeguard this individual, but it only survived for 30 days in captivity. On January 24th, 2003, another adult female (body length 352 cm) was accidentally caught in Yibin, Sichuan Province China (upper reach of Yangtze River). It was tagged with an ultra-sonic tag and released by Dr. Wei’s team from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences. Unfortunately, after 12 hours of tracking, communication was disconnected and contact with the fish got lost. Between 2006 and 2008, Dr. Wei’s team used a number of boats to deploy 4,762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering a stretch of 412.5 km of the upper Yangtze River attempting to catch the last remaining individuals, but failed to get a single one (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009). The team also used hydroacoustic equipment to survey the river, also without success (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009). Time of extinction was estimated to be by around 2005 and in any case no later than by 2010. The Chinese Paddlefish reached functional extinction in during the early 1990s (Zhang <em>et al</em>.2020).",,"The Chinese Paddlefish was found in the Yangtze River in China. They spent part of their life in the lower section of the Yangtze, including the brackish estuary water, migrated upstream into the Yangtze for spawning, which occurred in Spring from mid-March to early April. They primarily inhabited the large rivers, but sometimes moved into large lakes such as Poyang and Dongting Lake.",The species was caught for human consumption before 1983 and later was landed as bycatch.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<em>Psephurus gladius </em>is listed as a first-class state protected animal in China.

Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record.

Furthermore, over 1,700 feral sheep were culled on the island between 2009-2012 (Ortíz-Alcaraz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016) and as of 2012, sheep were completely eradicated from the island, facilitating a rapid, remarkable recovery in local vegetation cover (Ortíz-Alcaraz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lowen 2020). Reports that rats have recently colonised Socorro have proved to be unfounded (J. E.

The primary driver of the rapid population reduction and loss of most individuals is considered to be the introduction of the carnivorous fish<em>&#160;</em><em>Micropterus salmoides</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Channa striata</em><strong>&#160;</strong>(ZICOMA 1999), which caused adult mortality but more significantly reduced reproduction to near-zero.

Additional introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially&#160;<em>Tilapia</em>, probably depleted essential foods for the species<strong>&#160;</strong>(Pidgeon 1996). Conversion of natural habitat for agriculture also occurred at an increasing rate during this time, with deforestation resulting in sedimentation from soil erosion and water quality being lowered, and considerable area has been converted to rice farms<strong>&#160;</strong>(Wilmé 1994). The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra proliferated more recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;The final few individuals may have been lost through hybridisation with <em>T. ruficollis</em>, although this appears to have been occurring for a long time as the type series from 1932 includes a presumed hybrid (Delacour 1932, Collar and Stuart 1985, Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Poaching may also have played a role in the extinction of the species (Wilmé 1994), although larger-bodied waterbirds are thought to have always been the primary target of hunters (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000).  <p></p>","The species was described in 1932 from Lake Alaotra (Delacour 1932) and in 1960 grebe flocks on the lake contained <em>c. </em>50 individuals alongside Little Grebe <em>T. ruficollis </em>and Madagascar Little Grebe <em>T. pelzelnii</em>, but also a number of hybrids with <em>T. ruficollis&#160;</em>(Voous and Payne 1965, Collar and Stuart 1985). Thirteen specimens were collected at this time (Voous and Payne 1965), presumably out of the total of 50 (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000). Numerous other reports from a wider area are given in Collar and Stuart (1985), but none were documented and were subsequently considered to be in error for <em>T. pelzelnii. </em>In&#160;1982 <em>c. </em>12 individuals were identified as still present, along with several hybrids (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000).

It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","<p>Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.</p>  <p>Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>, dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>. With Europeans and Americans came Black <em>R. rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em>, cats <em>Felis catus</em>, mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, feral goats <em>Capra hircus</em>, cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>, deer <em>Axis axis</em>, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for <em>H. affinis</em> and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions.</p>  <p>Both avian malaria <em>Plasmodium relictum</em> and avian pox <em>Avipoxvirus spp.</em> are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for <em>Culex</em> and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe <em>et al.</em> 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of <em>Culex </em>will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).</p><p>The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa <em>Akialoa lanaiensis</em>, that occupied somewhat similar niches to <em>H. affinis</em>, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.</p><p></p>","After no sightings for more than 60 years, <em>Hemignathus affinis</em>&#160;was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of&#160;<em>Chlorodrepanis virens </em>and possibly <em>Pseudonestor xanthophrys </em>(Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources.

Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp<em> in litt.</em> 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009).

Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that <em>H. affinis&#160;</em>was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009).

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where <em>G. floridana</em> was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover <em>G. floridana</em> have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann <em>et al</em>. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.<br/><br/>An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by&#160;Thompson<em>&#160;et al</em>. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the&#160; Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996).

229337053,60095,Urolophus javanicus,Extinct,,2023,2023-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>The Java Stingaree (<em>Urolophus javanicus</em>) is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia. The species’ full distribution and habitat is undefined but given a lack of records in surrounding areas it is assumed to have had a restricted range in the Java Sea. The species was small, with the only known specimen measuring 33.8 cm total length. Based on size, the maturity of the holotype cannot be inferred. The Java Stingaree was one of only two stingaree species in Indonesia and is believed to be unique within the Java region and nearby areas. Rays are heavily exploited and utilized in Indonesia, making up 60% of the national total elasmobranch (shark and ray) catch. Intensive, generally unregulated fishing was likely the major threat resulting in the depletion of the Java Stingaree population, with coastal fisheries catches already declining in the 1870s. Catches on the northern coast of Java in 1940 were down to almost half the annual catch landed in the 1860s. Additionally, the northern coast of Java, particularly Jakarta Bay, is heavily industrialized, and extensive habitat loss and degradation may also have impacted this species. Coastal habitats likely utilized by the Java Stingaree have been replaced with aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s. The life history of the Java Stingaree is not known, however urolophids are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (as low as 1–2 pups/year). The species was therefore likely highly susceptible to population reduction and depletion. Despite extensive survey efforts since 2001 including monitoring of fish landing sites along the northern coast of Java (including Jakarta), as well as elsewhere in Indonesia, no further specimens have been recorded. Previously assessed in 2021 as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (CR(PE)), a reassessment has been undertaken with further information on threats and survey effort.<br/><br/>The Framework for using the Threats Model and the Records and Surveys Model to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction, and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species, were both extremely high. The Java Sea and surrounding waters have a long history of fisheries development and fishing effort has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985. The probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.00). There have been no planned species-specific surveys, but there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of sharks and rays in general in Java since 2001. It is highly likely that these surveys would have recorded the species if it were present given the Java Stingaree’s uniqueness within the Java Sea region and surrounds. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.97 (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). Both model results are &gt;0.9 and therefore the Java Stingaree<em> </em>meets the threshold for the Extinct category.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype, a female of 33.8 cm total length (TL)/19.1 cm disc width (DW) collected from a fish market in Jakarta, Indonesia (Martens 1864). The size of this specimen falls within the known range of female size-at-maturity for urolophids (20–50 cm TL across nine species; Last <em>et al.</em> 2016), and therefore maturity of the holotype cannot be inferred. Its previous habitat is unknown, however stingarees generally inhabit waters of the continental and insular shelves while a few species occur in deeper slope waters to 430 m depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Java Sea is relatively flat (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) and this topography offers relatively little variability in habitats available to species in this region.<br/><br/>The life history of the species is unknown, but urolophids have some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays, with five studied species producing 1–2 pups per year (White <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2016). Urolophids reproduce annually or biennially, with long gestation lengths of at least 10–12 months and up to 19 months (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Urolophid embryos are also readily aborted upon capture (White <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kyne <em>et al. </em>2016), indicating a reduction in reproductive potential in heavily fished regions even if released alive after capture. The Java Stingaree is therefore likely to have had limited resilience to overexploitation.</p><br/><p></p>","Demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia for decades (Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2006), if not consistently since the 1870s when declines were first reported (Yuwono 2001). Indonesia has also been the world’s largest shark and ray producer and exporter of fins and meat since 1998, and ranked among the top 20 shark fishing nations since 1980 (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Sharks and rays are captured and retained in targeted fisheries and as bycatch across Indonesia (White and Dharmadi 2007, Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018, Clark-Shen <em>et al.</em> 2022). The historical range of the Java Stingaree is subject to intense inshore fishing pressure, which is largely unregulated, and the relatively shallow waters of the Java Sea (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) provide no refuge at depth. The Java Sea demersal coastal fishery catch was declining by the end of the 1800s (Yuwono 2001), and from 1976 to 1997 the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). Total fishing effort in Indonesia has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985 (Squires <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). Despite this, until recently fisheries policies aimed to increase fishing capacity, causing declines in stocks and catch rates of sharks and rays throughout Indonesia (Squires <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). The Java Sea is currently Indonesia’s second largest Fisheries Management Area in terms of catch (tonnes) and produces significantly higher ray landings than sharks (Prasetyo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Ray species of the family Dasyatidae make up the majority of ray catches in Indonesia (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2009, Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018, Prasetyo <em>et al.</em> 2021), many of which would be predicted to occupy the same habitats and interact with the same fishing gears as the Java Stingaree. Rays are captured and usually retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries in Indonesia which use a range of fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook-and-line, trap, and seine net (White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015). The high market value of many shark and ray products, particularly fins, makes targeted fishing a profitable venture, and fishers are incentivized to retain sharks and rays (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018, D’Alberto <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>Shallow inshore waters around the Indo-Malay Archipelago are also threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). Approximately 90% of Jakarta Bay’s shoreline has been modified for development, including urban, industrial, agricultural, or aquaculture purposes (Bengen <em>et al.</em> 2006), with the destruction of mangrove habitats for aquaculture ponds beginning in the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). In Jakarta, services and infrastructure such as sewage and wastewater treatment plants are not capable of facilitating the whole human population, leading to pollution of waterways surrounding the megacity (Dsikowitzky <em>et al.</em> 2016). As a result, coastal ecosystems of the heavily industrialized Jakarta Bay are significantly degraded through habitat loss (including the Jakarta Reclamation Project), increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination which has resulted in mercury bioaccumulation in rays in Jakarta Bay (see Hosono <em>et al.</em> 2011 and references within; Budiyanto <em>et al.</em> 2015). Coastal habitats have also undergone degradation as a result of destructive fishing practices (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018). Species occurring in small geographic ranges are generally more sensitive to threatening processes (Joppa <em>et al.</em> 2016), and the stressors on the aquatic environment surrounding the growing Jakarta region are intense and ever-increasing.","The only known Java Stingaree specimen was a female collected in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1862, and since then considerable survey effort in Indonesia, particularly since 2001, has failed to locate further specimens. Extensive surveys of landing sites and fish markets have been conducted in Indonesia (e.g., Adrim and Fahmi 2007, White and Dharmadi 2007, Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fahmi 2012, Ernawati <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tirtadanu <em>et al</em>. 2018, Simeon <em>et al</em>. 2017, Simeon <em>et al</em>. 2018, Simeon <em>et al</em>. 2021, Yuwandana <em>et al</em>. 2019). Shark and ray catches at Indonesian landing sites are also continually monitored by trained government agencies and non-governmental organizations (e.g., Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center [SEAFDEC], Rekam Nusantara Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Society [WCS]) and no contemporary specimens, photographs, or genetic evidence of the species have been found. Despite &gt;28,000 individual rays being examined in Indonesian landing sites (including Jakarta) between 2001 and 2006 (White and Dharmadi 2007), and extensive surveys in Indonesia (including the Java Sea region) between 2007 and 2022, the Java Stingaree has not been recorded (Supplementary Information). The majority of ray catch at major landing sites is made up of rays from the family Dasyatidae (White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2009, Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018, Prasetyo <em>et al</em>. 2021). This includes individuals as small as 9.1 cm disc width (DW) (<em>Hemitrygon longicauda</em> [referred to as <em>Dasyatis</em> sp. 1]) and 9.2 cm DW (<em>Telatrygon biasa</em> [<em>Dasyatis zugei</em>], <em>Brevitrygon javaensis</em> [<em>Himantura</em> cf. <em>walga</em>]) (White and Dharmadi 2007). Because even low-value products are landed for markets such as salted or smoked meat, fishmeal, and pet food, it is very likely that, if extant, further Java Stingaree specimens would have been taken to landing sites if captured and subsequently recorded by observers. The species was also not recorded in trawl surveys in the Java Sea at depths of 15–70 m in 2015 and 2017, which recorded several species of rays, also dominated by stingrays of the family Dasyatidae (Ernawati <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tirtadanu <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Since the only Java Stingaree specimen was collected at a fish market, the species’ geographic range limits and habitat have not been defined. Most other urolophid species have restricted geographic ranges and/or are restricted to a single country (see Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). A restricted range is assumed for the Java Stingaree due to a lack of records from adjacent islands which are also monitored and the general pattern of small geographic range size in this family. In the 1860s, fishers were limited by fishing technology and the size and facilities of their fishing vessels. Javan fishing vessels were too small to provide spaces for catch to be preserved or salted onboard, so fishers generally remained within 40 km of the coastline, and it is likely that fishing grounds worked from Jakarta in the late 1800s did not exceed more than one-third of the Java Sea (Yuwono 2001). The Java Stingaree holotype was collected as a fresh specimen at a landing site (Martens 1864) and was therefore likely collected within 40 km seaward of Jakarta. It is unlikely that the species was restricted to an area as small as Jakarta Bay, but it is reasonable to assume it may have been restricted to the Java Sea. Therefore, for this assessment, the threats and surveys that encompass the Java Sea and the northern coast of Java were considered.<br/><br/>The Framework (Akçakaya <em>et al</em>. 2017) for using the Threats Model (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2017) and the Records and Surveys Model (Thompson <em>et al</em>. 2017) to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The Models were developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be applied under a range of possible scenarios including to calculate the probability of extinction (P(E)) for rare species with a limited number of records over an observed time series. The Threats Model considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the species’ life history characteristics to determine the probability that a species is extinct (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indonesia represents the world’s largest shark fishing nation by catch (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Fisheries in Java have a long history, with the first reports of coastal fishery resources becoming depleted by the late 1800s (Yuwono 2001). Unregulated small-scale fisheries and large-scale commercial trawls since the 1970s have driven recent overexploitation in the region, and the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings from 1976 to 1997 (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). There are numerous large fishing ports and landing sites in Java, and local depletion of shark and ray resources in the Java Sea have led local fishers to access resources further afield (e.g., Kalimantan, Papua). Java is the world’s most populated island with a population of over 140 million people, the majority of which are located on the northern coast of Java. Jakarta is a growing megacity with intense levels of human pressure on coastal habitats and resources. Jakarta Bay is heavily industrialized and coastal ecosystems are significantly degraded through habitat loss, increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination. Mangrove habitats have been replaced with industrial areas, urban areas, and aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). Further habitat destruction has resulted from government policy, namely the Reclamation Policy of 1995 and the subsequent Jakarta Reclamation Project beginning in 2015.<br/><br/>The life history of the Java Stingaree is unknown, however urolophids are well-studied and are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (White <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2016). Gestation length is considered relatively long, spanning at least 10–12 months (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016), and reproductive potential is considered low (White <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is therefore considered highly susceptible to population decline as a result of threats. Consequently, the probability that the combination of threats affecting the Java Stingaree occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction <em>P(local)</em> and the probability that the threats occurred over the entire range of the species <em>P(spatial)</em> were both extremely high (minimum = 0.90; best = 0.95; maximum = 1.0). As a result, the probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 or 90% (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.0).<br/><br/>The Records and Surveys Model estimates the probability that a species is extinct based on a time series of known records of the species, and the timing, extent, and species-specific adequacy of surveys (Thompson <em>et al</em>. 2017). The species is known from a single record, the holotype collected in 1862. <em>p(ci)</em> (the probability that the species was correctly identified as extant) was therefore set at 1 (lower; best; upper) as per guidelines in the Instructions (see the <a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/ex-probability"">Instructions</a> document on the IUCN Red List website). The proportion of the species’ range covered by passive surveys (epsilon) was set at a moderate level (epsilon: lower = 0.4; best = 0.5; upper = 0.6) due to the restricted range of the species and extensive coverage by fishers who fish daily and usually land catches locally. The probability that the species would have been recorded (<em>p(r)</em>) or reliably identified (<em>p(i)</em>) in passive surveys was low (<em>p(r)</em>: lower = 0.1; best = 0.15; upper = 0.2; <em>p(i)</em>: lower = 0; best = 0.1; upper = 0.2) due to the rarity, small-size, and low economic value of the Java Stingaree, and lack of species-level knowledge held by fishers, as per the Instructions.<br/><br/>There have been no surveys targeted specifically at locating further specimens of this species, however, there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of elasmobranchs in general in Java, and it is highly likely that these surveys would have documented the presence of the Java Stingaree if it had been caught. It is worth noting that these surveys have recorded many rare species, including many rare ray species (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007). An intensive focus on survey effort for elasmobranchs commenced in 2001 (see White and Dharmadi 2007) and some form of survey in West Java, Central Java, Jakarta, and/or the Java Sea has taken place near annually since (Supplementary Information). Monitoring landing sites is a standard approach to surveying fishes in Asia and is very effective for documenting catches and species given the pooling of ‘samples’ at one location. Landing site surveys in Indonesia since 2001 have resulted in the description of over 20 new shark and ray species (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Landing site surveys are likely to have included catch from throughout the likely depth range of the Java Stingaree. Prior to 2001, there had been little dedicated survey effort since the early ichthyological expeditions of the 1800s (see White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Surveys that occurred in Jakarta, the Java Sea, or the northern coast of West Java and Central Java were included in the Records and Surveys Model, while surveys in the same area examining landings from fisheries unlikely to interact with the Java Stingaree (e.g., pelagic longlines) were excluded. Pelagic longlines, for example, are unlikely to capture demersal species such as urolophids because they are not bottom-set.<br/><br/>The proportion of the species’ range that was covered by dedicated surveys varied each year, with an average <em>best</em> value of 0.46 (epsilon <em>best</em> ranging from 0.15–0.9). The proportion of geographic range surveyed was increased for some years from the previous assessment (Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2021), taking into account the number of landing sites surveyed for that year and any fisheries-independent surveys. Since landing site surveys in Jakarta and Java more broadly monitor catches arriving from throughout the Java Sea and adjacent waters (Fahmi pers. obs. 2021), the proportion of the species’ geographic range surveyed is higher in years with multiple landing site surveys. Javan fishers may possibly land their catches outside of this area, and although not included in surveys for this assessment, these landing sites have also not recorded another Java Stingaree individual.<br/><br/>The probability that the Java Stingaree would have been recorded in these surveys (<em>p(r)</em>) was set with a <em>best</em> value of 0.3 each year (lower = 0.2; upper = 0.4) following the suggested default values given in the Instructions for rare species (see Table 3 in the&#160;<a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/ex-probability"">Instructions</a>&#160;document). The probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the survey if it were recorded (<em>p(i)</em>) was set with a <em>best </em>value of 0.8 each year (lower = 0.7; upper = 0.9) based on the Instructions for species that are not particularly difficult to identify or distinguish from similar species, and that were searched for by seemingly competent surveyors (see Table 4 in the&#160;<a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/ex-probability"">Instructions</a>&#160;document). These values were chosen based on the Instructions because the species is the sole member of the family Urolophidae occurring in Java; the only other species in Indonesia is the Kai Stingaree (<em>Urolophus kaianus</em>) from far eastern Indonesia (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Although the stingray fauna (family Dasyatidae) is diverse in Indonesia, misidentification by trained surveyors is unlikely to have occurred as urolophids are easily distinguishable from dasyatids due to their short tails with an obvious elongate lobe-like caudal fin (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>The probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Records and Surveys Model is 0.97, or 97% (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). The overall probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct in 2023 is the average of the results for both Models, which is 0.94 or 94%. The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.93 for both weighting methods. The Models also separately calculate the probability that the species is extant (<em>P(Xt)</em>) each year over the observation period (1862–2023). The probability that the Java Stingaree is extant in 2023 is 0.03 or 3%. Both model results are &gt;0.9, and therefore fall within the threshold for the Extinct category.<br/><br/>This species has been reassessed due to expert opinion of the assessors that some of the parameters used in the previous assessment were set too low. The parameters which were changed from the previous assessment (Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2021) were <em>P(local)</em>, <em>P(spatial)</em>, and epsilon for dedicated surveys. The assessors each determined their best estimates for the extent and duration of threats (<em>P(local)</em> and <em>P(spatial)</em>) occurring throughout the Java Sea, and these individual estimates were used to determine the best estimates for this assessment. The proportion of geographic range surveyed (epsilon) was also increased for some of the survey years. This was based on consideration of the often very large geographic areas used by fishers delivering catches to landing sites. The estimates of epsilon for this assessment were therefore made by considering the number of landing sites surveyed in a particular year, and whether any fisheries-independent surveys also occurred in that year. Given that the geographic range of the Java Stingaree could have been restricted to a portion of the Java Sea (rather than the entire Java Sea as used in this assessment), the approach that was used to estimate epsilon is considered conservative. This reassessment also included updated recent survey effort for the years 2021 and 2022.<p>For further information, see the Supplementary Information. </p>",,"The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia in the Western Central Pacific (Martens 1864, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). The full geographic extent of the species’ historical range is uncertain, but the Java Stingaree was presumed to have had a relatively restricted distribution in the Java Sea due to a lack of records in surrounding areas. Further, the capability of fishing vessels in the 1800s (Yuwono 2001) indicate that the holotype was likely collected within 40 km of Jakarta’s shoreline.<p></p>","Rays are heavily exploited and utilized in Indonesia, and are caught and retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries for their meat and skin (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018, D’Alberto <em>et al</em>. 2022). As the only known specimen was collected from a fish market (Martens 1864), the species is likely to have been utilized when caught. The meat of small, lower value species is often consumed in coastal communities as salted or smoked fish (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018). There is a demand for ray meat on the northern coast of Java due to the growing human population, with smoked rays popular in cities along the coast (B. Simeon pers. obs. 2023). Low value fishes can also be utilized as fishmeal or pet food.",Marine,"There are no species-specific measures implemented for the management or conservation of this species in Indonesia. Current legal and regulatory frameworks in Indonesia are considered insufficient to manage exploitation of sharks and rays within sustainable limits (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although some rays, including the Kai Stingaree (<em>Urolophus kaianus</em>) recently became protected under Minister Decree 1/2021, there has been no enforcement (B. Simeon pers. obs. 2023) and there are no current management or conservation actions related to artisanal ray fisheries in Indonesia. The Indonesian Government banned trawl fishing in 2015, however small trawl fisheries still operate in some areas of northern Java.","",July 1862,false,false,Global

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.<p></p> <p></p>","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900&#160;m, mainly 1,200-1,500&#160;m (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie&#160;<em>Freycinetia arborea</em>, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<p></p>","<p>Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats,&#160;primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species.&#160;At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).</p><p>With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.</p><p>Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>, dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>. With the Europeans and Americans came Black <em>R. rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em>, cats <em>Felis catus</em>, mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, feral goats <em>Capra hircus</em>, cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>, deer <em>Axis axis</em>, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source,<strong>&#160;</strong>‘ie‘ie vine <em>Freycinetia arborea</em> (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).<br/><br/>Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions.&#160;Both avian malaria <em>Plasmodium relictum</em> and avian pox <em>Avipoxvirus</em> spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of <em>Culex</em> will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for <em>Culex</em> and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe <em>et al</em>. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2023).</p><p>For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest.

Small areas of slightly higher ground carried sparse stands of Drooping She-oak <em>Allocasuarina verticillata</em>, which were used for shelter.

By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed, and led to the death of some of the few remaining individuals.

Despite numerous reports of sightings since then including on mainland Australia (Heberle 2004), and many organised searches in Tasmania by government agencies, conservation NGOs, philanthropists, and others (more search effort than any other extinct mammal (Fisher and Blomberg 2011)), there has been no convincing evidence of its persistence. Brook <em>et al</em>. (2023) used uncertainty modelling of purported sightings to map a regional extirpation pattern, and concluded that it probably persisted until the 1980s, however Mooney (2023) concluded that no sightings since 1936 can be substantiated. All data sets analysed with a conservative probabilistic sighting-record resampling by Brook <em>et al.</em> (2023) concluded that the Thylacine has 100% probability of being extinct in 2023. The statistical approaches of Brook <em>et al</em>. (2023), Carlson <em>et al.</em> (2018) and Fisher &amp; Blomberg (2011, 2012) are robust probabilistic extinction models using sighting data that included uncertainty of records, distribution variables, search effort, and other trait data. There have been at least six classes of quantitative models applied to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of the thylacine in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Fisher and Humphries 2024). 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow 1993), 2) Weibull model / Optimal linear estimation (Roberts and Solow 2003), 3) Nonparametric (Solow and Smith 2005), 4) Cox Regression Survival model of threat and effort (Fisher and Blomberg 2012), 5) Bayesian Stationary Poisson model with varying certainty of sightings and independent processes for valid and invalid sightings (Solow and Beet 2014, Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2018), 6) Stationary Poisson with resampling (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, Brook <em>et al.</em> 2023). These have used a range of assumptions about the data distribution and certainty, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and sets of different sources of data including sighting dates, species traits, measures of effort, distributional data, and observer reliability. Virtually all have concluded that the Thylacine is extinct, and nearly all (and all with physical evidence) have concluded that the extinction date was in the 1930s or 1940s. Additionally, from 2014 to 2020, 3,225 camera trap sites throughout Tasmania leading to photographs on &gt;315,000 camera nights revealed no detections of anything that could be attributed to a Thylacine (C.N. Johnson pers. comm.).","Thylacines occurred in most habitats in Tasmania, but apparently not the dense temperate rainforests of the south-west (Paddle 2000). The skull of the Thylacine is highly convergent with the wolf suggesting similar dietary ecology (Newton 2021), although it probably had a less powerful bite than a wolf (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). It was likely an endurance runner ('coursing predator') that hunted and scavenged mainly at night, singly or in pairs. Before it was widely persecuted, diurnal observations were also reported (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its main food items were reported to be kangaroos and wallabies. Dens were often located among rocks and in caves, Paddle (1993) describes a 1903 photograph of a den in a shallow cave containing nesting material of ferns. Litters (of up to four young, usually two or three) were also discovered amongst dense vegetation.","<p>There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of a perceived threat to sheep, and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). From 1830 (less than three decades after Europeans arrived in Tasmania), companies and individual landowners began offering bounty payments (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its eradication was funded by a Tasmanian government scheme from 1888 to 1909, and a bounty was paid for more than 2,200 Thylacines killed (Heberle <em>et al</em>. 2004, Sleightholme and Campbell 2016). This is a similar number to the estimated Thylacine population of Tasmania at any one time (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Collecting by museums and zoos was also a major reason for hunting in the early 20th century. A disease similar to canine distemper could have contributed to extinction (Paddle 2012). However single-species population viability analysis models are unable to account for extinction unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate is assumed, even if disease effects are included from 1906 to 1909. Thylacine extinction in Tasmania is readily recreated using disease-free multi-species models that simulate declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>",This species is presumed to be extinct.,,"<p>                 The Thylacine was once found on the island of New Guinea and was widespread on the Australian mainland, but disappeared from everywhere except Tasmania by at least 2000 years ago, probably because of predation by and competition from the Dingo <em>Canis lupus</em> (Johnson 2006). In modern times it was known only in Tasmania, which was isolated from the Australian mainland c. 8,000 – 10,000 years ago, before the arrival of the Dingo on the mainland. It was widespread in Tasmania, but most abundant in open forest and woodland (Guiler 1985, Paddle 2000).

As the species was also considered a pest, it was heavily hunted during the 1800s (Hume 2017).
