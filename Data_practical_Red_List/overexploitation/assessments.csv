3149101,9023,Chelonoidis niger,Extinct,,2017,2017-01-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species collapsed from an estimated historical population in the early 19th century of about 8,000 animals on Floreana (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data), to extinction in the wild on Floreana sometime in the mid 1800s. No genetically pure live Floreana Tortoises are known to exist, although a small number of adults held in captivity contain historical Floreana genetic material, with at least one animal at up to 80% niger genome (Poulakakis et al. 2008, Russello et al. 2010, Garrick et al. 2012). Additionally, genetic analyses have identified many tortoises on Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela that have partial Floreana ancestry. Today an estimated 100 to 200 animals with partial Floreana tortoise ancestry remain on Wolf Volcano; so far 84 individuals have been identified from genetic analyses (Garrick et al. 2012). Although no living pure niger animals are confirmed, the possibility exists that some animals on Wolf Volcano may be genetically pure Floreana Tortoises. Overall, in the absence of confirmed genetically pure animals, Chelonoidis niger should continue to be considered Extinct until documented otherwise. ""Chelonoidis nigra ssp. nigra"" was assessed as Extinct in the 1996 IUCN Red List. This assessment incorporates knowledge contributions from the international workshop on Galápagos tortoises convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate in July 2012.","No specific information on the habitat preferences and ecology of Chelonoidis niger is available; in all likelihood its biology and diet would have been analogous with other saddlebacked Galápagos tortoise species, a morphological adaptation that increases the vertical range of foraging options, from grazing on herbaceous vegetation to browsing on shrubs and cactus during dry periods when low-growing vegetation  is unavailable.","The precise cause of extinction is not exactly known, but most likely involved a combination of direct exploitation by sailors and settlers, as well as the impacts of invasive species. Historically, Cheloniodis niger was exploited as food by sailors provisioning their ships; a settlement was established on the island by 1829 and later converted to a penal colony; pigs, dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, and cattle were introduced around 1832 with the introduction of Black Rats and house mice likely occurred around the same time.","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size was estimated to have been about 8,000 adults (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). This species was exposed to intense exploitation by whalers in the early 1800s, collecting animals as provisions and to produce oil, with the last large loads of tortoises from Floreana recorded as occurring between 1831 and 1837 (Townsend 1925, Pritchard 1996). Available population information for Chelonoidis niger indicates that the population was not rare during the 1830s, but had collapsed by about 1850 (Pritchard 1996). Charles Darwin saw no live tortoises when he visited in 1835 and only a handful of tortoises appear to have been collected between 1840 and 1847, with final rapid extinction estimated to have occurred in about 1850 (Broom 1929, Steadman 1986). However, several individuals showing hybridization between  C. niger  and  C. becki have recently been discovered on Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela, as well as some with partial ancestry from other islands, including Española and a few from southern Isabela, and some in captivity at the Galápagos National Park’s Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz Island, probably as a result of C. niger being released on Isabela by whalers or other mariners prior to the 1830s (as with C. abingdonii), suggesting that the taxon’s genome may not yet be fully extirpated (Poulakakis et al. 2008, Russello et al. 2010, Garrick et al. 2012, TEWG 2015). These hybrid individuals exhibit strong genetic signatures of Floreana tortoises, as established by genetic analysis of the type specimen, indicating that their ancestry involves C. niger ancestors possibly only one or two generations back.","","Chelonoidis niger occurred on Floreana [formerly Santa María or Charles Island] in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. Floreana has a total surface area of 172.5 sq.km, of which ca 81 sq. km (47%) could potentially sustain tortoises (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data).","This species was exposed to intense exploitation by whalers and other seamen in the 1700s and early 1800s, collecting animals as provisions, with the last large loads of tortoises from Floreana recorded as occurring between 1831 and 1837 (Townsend 1925, Pritchard 1996).",Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulations: Chelonoidis niger is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975, prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. Most of Floreana (98%), and thus the historic range of niger, is protected as part of the Galápagos National Park.Tortoise population restoration on Floreana is currently planned via release of offspring from selectively chosen tortoises with partial Floreana ancestry derived from those identified on Wolf Volcano on Isabela and those in captivity; this complex restoration project was begun in 2015 and will require at least a decade or more for full implementation.

6955940,173001,Cyclura onchiopsis,Extinct,,2011,2010-09-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"No individuals of this iguana have been collected or observed since the middle of the 19th century, despite a number of visits to the island and its occupation during the early 20th century by a resident lighthouse keeper. Schwatrz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century is a more probable explanation.","Surrounded by cliffs, the portions of Navassa Island presumably capable of supporting iguanas prior to their extinction was characterized by Ekman (1929), Proctor (1959), and paraphrased in Powell (1999). The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (Ficus populnea var. brevifolia), False Mastic (Sideroxylon foetidissimum), Pigeon Plum (Coccoloba diversifolia), and Poisonwood (Metopium brownei). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.Among the five specimens known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000). Based on the morphology of similar species, this is probably far less than the maximum for this iguana.","Like other rock iguanas, the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana was probably threatened by non-native predators, hunting for human consumption, and non-native competitors which destroyed the vegetation. Schwartz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century was a more probable explanation.",No individuals have been collected or observed since the middle of the 19th century.

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,Extinct,,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The red alga Vanvoorstia bennettiana has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world). The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855. This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels. The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships. This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988. Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until 23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site. No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus Sargassum, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions. The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886. This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since. The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic. The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata and the green alga Caulerpa filiformis growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions. No specimens of Vanvoorstia bennettiana have been discovered. Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline. Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus Vanvoorstia, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which Vanvoorstia bennettiana belongs, such areas should harbor this species. In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [Vanvoorstia bennettiana] either cast up or by dredging."" He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936. The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position. She was also unable to rediscover this species. Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast. Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between. The red algal species Vanvoorstia bennettiana has not been discovered during any of these dives. Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations. This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce. There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable. In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters. The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886. The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores. Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

Paxton in litt.].","","","First collected/discovered (1855) by crude dredging as a single individual plant from the east end of Spectacle Island, in the Parramatta River, Port Jackson, Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. Hector (1871) reported of immense and conspicuous shoals ascending the Hutt River (southern North Island) in January. Apparently, however, signs of decreasing numbers were evident soon afterwards. The disappearance of the fish from the Waikato River (North Island) was noted to have occurred in 1874. In 1878, Rutland (who studied the species in the Nelson and Marlborough district, South Island), noted that in the Maitai River (n the north of the South Island) it had 'become very scarce during the past three years'. This disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. There are reports of this species being caught in the 1920s and in the early 1930s a specimen (possibly the last), was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010, Best 1929, Radway-Allen 1949).",Unknown,"The New Zealand Grayling (Prototroctes oxyrhynchus) was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori prior to European settlement and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing.

22159785,7121,Elaphurus davidianus,Extinct in the Wild,,2016,2016-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Extinct in the Wild. The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be established some time in the near future. When that happens, its Red List status will need to be reassessed.","Studies have been carried out on the behaviour, ecology and reproduction of Père David’s Deer in Beijing since 1985, in Dafeng since 1986, and in Shishou since 2001. This species lives in low-lying grasslands and reed beds, often in seasonally flooded areas such as the lower Yangtze River valley and coastal marshes. It eats grass, reeds and leaves of bushes, can swim well, and spend long periods in water. It lives in single sex ormaternal herds. Animals reach maturity during second year. Gestation is 270-300 days. One, rarely two young are born. These are weaned in 10-11 months. Adults live up to 18 years. Data from the Dafeng Reserve suggests that female E. davidianus establish a home range of approximately 1 km² (Hu and Jiang 2002).","The species became extinct in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting. The size of the reintroduced population was only 120 in 1993 (Cao 1993), although has increased to over 2,000 since that time (Yang et al. 2008). Low genetic diversity has been identified as a long-term threat by Zeng et al. (2007) and Yang et al. (2008). It is unclear how much native habitat remains on which E. davidianus can exist in a free-ranging state.","After decades of ex situ conservation, the species breeds successfully in captivity (Beck and Wemmer 1983). In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang et al. 2000a).The second re-introduction of E. davidianus was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang et al. 2000b). The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang et al. 2000b). E. davidianus from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang et al. 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 E. davidianus in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. In November, 2002, 30 E. davidianus (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li et al. 2007). Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of E. davidianus in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang et al. 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed E. davidianus herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.","","This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. Fossils of Elaphurus bifurcatus, E. chinanensis chia, E. lantianensis have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of Elaphurus, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, P. davidianus was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of P. davidianus shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). P. davidianus is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of P. davidianus in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” P. davidianus in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52). Nevertheless, the heavily inbred Père David’s Deer safely passed though the genetic bottleneck of inbreeding and adopted the vast open parkland of an English country estate (Jones et al. 1983).The captive population started to increase (though with a setback during the First World War due to food shortage), and since the Second World War, the animals started to be spread through captive facilities worldwide, with the first captive animals being sent back to Beijing Zoo in 1956.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is listed on the Chinese Red List as Extinct in the Wild, and on the China Key List - I.

Conduct surveys of the four free-living sub-populations in Hubei and Hunan provinces to assess their long-term viability.3. Establish a genetic management programme of all populations in China. 4. Develop conservation education programmes to raise conservation awareness among the local people and general public.Following a trial release of this species in the Dafeng Reserve, China, Hu and Jiang (2002) concluded that future releases will necessitate either natural or artificial boundaries to alleviate conflict between introduced E. davidianus and farmers, on whose land the deer are likely to stray. These authors suggest a reintroduction model based on that of Oryx leucoryx in Oman (Stanley Price 1989).",Palearctic,1939,false,false,Global

The genus is thought to have become extinct by 1768.,"When discovered, Steller's Sea Cow inhabited the shallow cold waters around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea, grazing on kelps.","Hydrodamalis was slaughtered for its meat and leather. Anderson (1995) discussed the ecological interaction between sea cows, sea otters, Strongylocentrotus sea urchins, and kelp, and suggested that human predation on sea otters (resulting in a nearshore community dominated by sea urchins, which largely eliminate shallow-water kelps leading to their replacement by chemically defended deep-water species) was a major factor, along with hunting, in sea cow extinction. Turvey et al. (2006) assessed whether hunting alone would have been sufficient to wipe out the sea cow, and showed that the speed of sea cow disappearance on Bering Island indicates that hunting alone was more than sufficient to exterminate the species without having to invoke any additional ecological pressures. Conversely, Estes et al. (2015) argued that hunting of sea otters alone could account for the sea cows’ extinction. Since both pressures actually occurred, there is no difficulty in understanding the rapid disappearance of Hydrodamalis from the Commander Islands.","Steller's Sea Cow was discovered in 1741 in the shallow waters around the uninhabited Commander Islands. The relict Bering Island population was studied by Georg Steller (a naturalist and physician onboard Vitus Bering's ship wrecked on the island in 1741). The sea cow was an easily available source of meat and the islands became a regular stop-over and stocking up point for Russian fur hunters until 1762-1763. Ruthlessly hunted, Steller's Sea Cow was probably extinct by 1768. Turvey and Risley (2006) presented a preliminary mathematical model of its extinction dynamics, providing evidence that the initial Bering Island sea cow population must have been higher than the 1,500 animals suggested by Stejneger (1887) to allow the species to survive even until 1768. Estes et al. (2015) presented further population modelling to show that hunting of sea otters could have driven the sea cows to extinction even without direct human overkill of the latter.","","Steller's Sea Cow was known from the Bering Sea. The last population was discovered by a Russian expedition wrecked on Bering Island in 1741. It is likely that a population also persisted in at least the western Aleutian Islands into the 18th century (Domning et al. 2007). There is also evidence of a population at St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea more than a thousand years ago (Crerar et al. 2014).

Their diet is unknown, but may have included eels, lobsters, octopus, and reef fish. Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land, and its lack of fear of humans and an unaggressive and curious nature contributed to its demise. They were medium-sized seals, with adult standard lengths of 200-240 cm (Allen 2004). Very little is known about the natural history of  the Caribbean Monk Seal, but related species mature at 4-8 years old, give birth to a single pup (usually annually), and can live to be more than 20 years old.","The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).","Caribbean Monk Seals were first discovered by Columbus in 1494, and early records testify to its abundance in several parts of the Caribbean. Population size prior to exploitation has been estimated as 233,000-338,000 (McClenachan and Cooper 2007). Hunting of Caribbean Monk Seals by Europeans for food began with Columbus, and many animals were killed for that reason over the following centuries. In the late 1600s hundreds of seals were killed primarily to be used for oil to lubricate machinery on sugar plantations. Additional animals were taken for public display and killed for museum specimens and other reasons (Hairr 2011). By the late 1880s the species was rare, though the Triangle Keys west of Yucatan remained a stronghold of the species until 1915 when about 200 animals were killed there (The Sixth Extinction Website 2007). The last reliable record from anywhere was of a small colony at Seranilla Bank, a group of tiny coral islands halfway between Jamaica and Honduras, in 1952 (Adams 2004). An aerial survey in 1973 covering much of the species known range did not produce any seal sightings (Kenyon 1977). Vessel surveys of the region in 1980 (Sergeant et al. 1980) and 1984 (LeBoeuf et al. 1986) also  failed to locate any seals. Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean Monk Seals by local fishermen and divers (see for example Boyd and Stanfield (1998)) almost certainly refer to wandering Hooded Seals that have been positively identified on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2001).","","The Caribbean Monk Seal inhabited primarily the Caribbean Sea, northwest to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It had been recorded from numerous islands reefs and cays, including the Bahamas and Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Yucatan Peninsula and southeast along the Central and South American coasts as far east as Guyana. The northernmost extralimital record is from Georgia in the southeastern United States (Allen 2004).

Although presently dominated by the unpalatable shrub renosterbos (Elytropappus rhinocerotis), this habitat would have possessed a high grass cover (Themeda triandra, Merxmuellera stricta) (Cowling and Heijnis 2001).","Although habitat loss and hunting played proximate roles in the extinction of the species, hunting merely tipped the species over the extinction edge it was already straddling, as long-term climate change is suspected to have played a more important role by fragmenting and reducing the resilience of the population (Kerley et al. 2009, Tyler Faith and Thompson 2013).",The last individual Blue Antelope was shot around 1800; it was the first African antelope to be hunted to extinction by European settlers (Klein 1974).,"","Historically the Blue Antelope was endemic to South Africa, where it was confined to a limited area of the southwestern Cape coast and where it was apparently uncommon. The species was first recorded in 1719 by Kolbe, and was described by Pallas in 1766 (Klein 1974) from material of uncertain provenance (Rookmaaker 1989). Its historical distribution is thus based on few records, of which only two can be considered to be reasonably precise (Kerley et al. 2009): Thunberg on 20 January 1774 and Le Vaillant in March/April 1783. An additional record in 1783 provided by Sparrman (1786) much further east at Krakeel River in the Langkloof may reflect a transported skin, given that this location is hundreds of kilometres east of other records. However, although the recent historical range is thought to be bounded by the locations of the Caledon, Swellendam and Bredasdorp, in the Western Cape (Skead 1980, Rookmaaker 1989), archaeological evidence suggests a previously much wider distribution: early in the Last Glacial (70,000–35,000 years before present (ybp)) it occurred on the grasslands of the Cape lowlands, south of the Cape Folded Belt from present day Grahamstown (farm ‘‘Uniondale’’) in the east to the vicinity of Saldanha Bay in the West. A similar distribution has been inferred for the early (ca 10,000 ybp) Holocene (Klein 1974, Cruz-Uribe et al. 2003). During the late Pleistocene (18,000–10,000 ybp), analysis of rock paintings reveal that the species occurred as far north as the eastern parts of South Africa’s Free State Province (Loubser et al. 1990, Plug and Engela 1992, Plug and Badenhorst 2001).","",Terrestrial,This species is now Extinct.,Afrotropical,1799-1800,false,false,Global

In all such instances investigated in Ecuador and Colombia, the plants are of the anthropogenic hybrid Brugmansia x candida (Hay et al. 2012: 172-177). It is quite clear that such instances do not represent self-sustaining sexually reproducing populations.The complete lack of evidence of fruit dispersal or spontaneous seedlings, combined with the presence of large numbers of fruits containing viable seed (though this not in B. insignis), suggests their dispersers are extinct.Hence, all the species should best be regarded as Extinct in the Wild.They are all threatened with total extinction in their native South America because of the ongoing practice of eradicating them from gardens because of their poisonous nature, combined with the progressive loss of the traditional (indigenous) knowledge of their multiple uses (which is what appears to have been the reason for their long-term survival, perhaps over millennia).","This species is cultivated in indigenous gardens, in areas with relatively even rainfall between 2500 and 5000 mm, supporting rain forest. It is occasional as a remnant in abandoned gardens (and there probably transient as the plants are not shade tolerant). There are widely scattered occurrences in cultivation, sometimes in more seasonal areas, and sometimes at up to ca. 2000 m, across to the Pacific slopes of the Andes. The elevation range within the putative native range of the species is 100-600 m.","As with all other species of Brugmansia, there are no records at all of wild populations of B. insignis. The absence of wild plants was first recorded (albeit in relation to other Brugmansia species) by Ruiz &amp; Pavón in the late 18th Century (Schultes and von Thene de Jamarillo-Arango 1998: 114). Later, in spite of decades of field work in NW South America, R.E. Schultes and his students Lockwood and Bristol, who specialized in this genus and other neotropical psychoactive plants, recorded finding no wild brugmansias at all (Bristol 1966, Lockwood 1973). Recent examination by Hay of numerous herbarium collections has turned up no specimens collected from the wild (Hay et al. 2012: 172).While it is valued by those who know well how to use it both medicinally and as an entheogen, it is feared for its toxicity and superstitions about its 'evil' nature by those who do not, and it is anecdotally reported as being eradicated from gardens, sometimes at the behest of local authorities in response to the use of scopolamine for criminal purposes.Loss of interest in cultivating this species, through loss of traditional healing skills, as well as active steps to eradicate it in places are the principal and current threats, as with other Brugmansia species.","Since this genus survives only in cultivation, its wild population is zero. There are anecdotal views expressed by some indigenous healers that plants of this (and other) Brugmansia species are being eradicated from some indigenous gardens due to its toxicity and the declining numbers of healers expert enough to use it safely. However, there are no quantitative data regarding this.","","Defining a native geographic range for this species is speculative. Lockwood (1973) formed the view that, despite the exclusive association of Brugmansias with human habitation, native distributions of the species could be defined and recognized by the presence of intraspecific variability and high levels of fruit set, in contrast to low variability and low or absent fruit set in clones taken outside their native range.However, Brugmansia insignis, while exhibiting high variability, rarely sets fruit for reasons that are unclear (though artificial hybridization demonstrates it is fertile). Hay et al. (2012: 94) mapped a putative native distribution based largely on the distribution of indigenous groups who make exclusive use of this Brugmansia species and who cultivate a range of several varieties: the eastern Andean foothills of western Amazonia from Colombia to Bolivia. It has also been recorded in the Colombian Dept. of Meta in the Orinoco drainage.There are scattered occurrences, almost always of single clones, in gardens well to the west of this putative native range, including wet areas of the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. One particular site of note is Santo Domingo de los Colorados, Ecuador, where is it quite commonly cultivated and used by the Tsáchila.","There is a very wide range of medicinal and spiritual uses among the indigenous people who cultivate it, with various forms (≃cultivars) recognized (Hay et al. 2012: 22-73). It is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant, but it is seldom seen in cultivation outside its presumed native range, and is virtually absent from cultivation outside of tropical South America.As with the rest of this genus, its usefulness, far from being a threat, appears to be what has allowed it to avoid complete extinction.",Terrestrial,"The complete absence of wild plants suggests, as with other Brugmansia species, that the disperser(s) is/are extinct. The continued existence of this species within its presumed native range is currently dependent on its being cultivated by indigenous people. Its ongoing survival appears dependent on maintenance or rehabilitation of cultural traditions in which it is used. Education about its cultural and practical value, as well as its precarious conservation status seem essential to counteract the negativity with which these plants are often seen. Legal protection may be desirable to counteract knee-jerk eradication of the plants by local authorities in response to criminal use (burundanga). In this species, and unlike other Brugmansia species, spontaneous fruit formation is extremely rare, though hand-pollination between different clones can be successful.

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the Craugastor rugulosus series (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the Craugastor rugulosus group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides. The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden et al. 2013, Wicaksono et al. 2017, Lyra et al. 2017, Neate-Clegg et al. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds et al. 2006, Blaustein et al. 2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J.

61462199,231,Acipenser dabryanus,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2019-09-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is endemic to China, where its natural range is restricted to the Yangtze River drainage and major tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, and Jialing rivers. In the late 20th century, the population declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. The population now appears to be Extinct in the Wild, as there is no evidence for natural reproduction any more, and no mature fish have been caught within the last 10 years.","Yangtze Sturgeon permanently lives in freshwater. It usually inhabits the upper and middle reaches of the river (it may also have entered the upper estuary of the Yangtze River). This species spawns in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–December). Its key spawning reach was between Maoshui and Hejiang, a stretch of 321.7 km (Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).","Historically, this species experienced unsustainable levels of fishing. Furthermore, mesh sizes of fishing nets have been reduced, thereby capturing young sturgeon, especially during the periods when many juveniles concentrate to feed. Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night. The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May. This is also the spawning season for Acipenser dabryanus, therefore spawning stocks were particularly vulnerable to capture. The construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981 and the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 have also caused major adverse effects to the habitat of this species and, prior to the wild population disappearing, these constructions caused the population to be restricted to the upstream river, above the dams. The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river. Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin. Much untreated waste water discharges into the river each year. Water quality is also affected by run-off caused by deforestation of the upper Yangtze Valley (Zhuang et al. 1997). Pollution has been declining regionally in recent years.","There seems to be no natural reproduction of this species any more, and there are no mature individuals of wild origin due to heavy overfishing. Historically, this was an important species in commercial fisheries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007). In the late 20th century, population numbers declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catch data between 1982 and 2019 indicate that since 2008, hundreds of individuals are being captured annually, all originating from releases (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). The species is now fully ranched, and no natural reproduction or natural population is documented in the wild. Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful. Since 2018, mature individuals have also been stocked. This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.","","This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system. Historically, under the natural, unaltered conditions that existed until the middle of the 20th century, this species inhabited the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its large tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, Jialing, Xiang and Han rivers, as well as the large lakes attached to the Yangtze River. Acipenser dabryanus had been extirpated from the lower river, possibly since 1995, and it was restricted to the upper main stream of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Province (Zhuang et al. 1997). Starting in 2007, the conservation release programme was carried out in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, this fish can be found in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the confluences with some tributaries. However, the majority of individuals observed in the river originate from large scale releases and reproduction of the species in the wild has not been confirmed for at least two decades (one generation length for this species is 30 years).","Acipenser dabryanus was caught intensively for human consumption until the year 2000. Since 2000, sturgeons are only taken accidentally as bycatch and were mostly released, however post-release survival was low.

Some cultivated specimens have been replanted in semi-wild situations since the 1980s, but little or no recruitment has been observed except at one site.The species was listed as ‘Critically Endangered C2a(i); D’ by Cairns-Wicks (2003). The transfer of status to ‘Extinct in the Wild’ is the result of the death of the last surviving individuals in the wild.","She Cabbage is a small tree, though it may reach 9 m in height under favourable conditions. Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months. There is considerable variation in seed viability between individuals which suggests a degree of self-incompatibility, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. The achenes possess a pappus and are dispersed by the wind, but at some sites the majority are consumed by introduced bird species.The unusually soft wood is prone to rapid decay and is host to several species of endemic wood-boring invertebrates. This xylophagous fauna is still poorly-known and its degree of overlap with other hosts is unclear. At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: Opogona sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.","Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18th Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.","From the 20th Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known. In the 1950s Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.","","The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island. This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19th Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant. Here a thriving population has been created amongst mixed stands of endemics, with a graded-age structure. In this favourable habitat, plants naturally self-seed to a moderate degree despite patchy levels of viability, although none of the progeny has yet reached maturity (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).",Afrotropical,2012,false,false,Global

Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (Mus musculus) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (Sus domesticus), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18th Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (Commidendrum robustum (Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived  of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (Mus musculus) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.","Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19th Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.","","The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.","",Terrestrial,"Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between T. erythroxylon and the related Dwarf Ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to T. erythroxylon parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.",Afrotropical,1950s,false,false,Global
67372085,30561,Trochetiopsis melanoxylon,Extinct,,2016,2015-06-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The St Helena Ebony Tree (Trochetiopsis melanoxylon) has been extinct for almost 200 years. Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (Capra hircus) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln. The exceptionally dense, black wood was potentially very valuable, but it seems likely that many of the remaining trees were carelessly harvested for crude timber or firewood, and the bark stripped as a tanning agent.","The last confirmed record was made by Banks and Solander in 1771 (Banks 1896). Roxburgh reported that a few plants survived until the early 19th Century (see Beatston 1816), though it seems likely that he did not see them personally.","","The Ebony Tree was formerly known from dry lowland valleys and hill slopes of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. Very few botanical records were made before the 19th Century when the island had already been severely degraded by deforestation and grazing. We thus know little about the original flora, particularly those species which disappeared during the early phase of human impact. However, since the Ebony Tree was economically important it received occasional mentions in historical documents, and clues to its presence can still be found today in the form of fragments of semi-fossilized wood which still litter some of the drier seaward slopes.From these indications, it appears that the species inhabited lowland areas of St Helena, especially along the south coast. Records have been made from Sandy Bay, Asses’ Ears, Devil’s Hole, Manati Bay, near Egg Island and Horse Pasture. Other possible locations include The Barn, High Knoll and Ebony Plain, but these are subject to potential confusion with the related Dwarf Ebony.",Fragments of ebony wood are still collected today.

67372241,37598,Nesiota elliptica,Extinct,,2016,2015-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The St Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica) is almost certainly Extinct. The population was extremely small for at least 120 years before the final tree died in 1994. Well under 1 km2 of suitable habitat remains along St Helena’s Central Ridge and this has been searched extensively by botanists over recent decades.,"Based on existing evidence, it appears that this species was an inhabitant of cloud forest around St Helena’s highest altitudes (above 750 m). The 20th Century specimen at Mt Actaeon grew in Tree Fern thicket (Cronk 2002), but it is also likely to have occurred in more mixed vegetation with other upland trees on steep slopes below the ridge crest. As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (Trochetiopsis erythroxylon (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (Lachanodes arborea (Roxb.) B.Nord.).The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months. The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).","The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18th Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20th Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests. It is entirely possible that susceptibility to introduced fungal pathogens may have played a longer term role in the overall demise.","Intact fragments of St Helena Olive habitat probably persisted until the late 1800s, when Solander noted trees up to 30 foot high (approx. 9 m) (see Cronk 2002). A century later, only 12-15 trees remained, and these reputedly attained little more than half the former stature (Melliss 1875). When George Benjamin discovered a single specimen near Mt Actaeon* in 1977 the species had not been seen for many years. This proved to be the last known wild specimen in existence. It died in 1994 but seedlings and a cutting had been propagated from it, and a few cultivated individuals continued the line. Unfortunately these did not survive long, the last succumbing to fungal infections in 2003.(*There is some controversy of the naming of the three summits in the Diana’s Peak range. We here refer to Mt Actaeon as the most northerly in the series.)","","The St Helena Olive formerly occurred in the uplands of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. So few specimens survived to the historical period that the original range is difficult to reconstruct. Nearly all old records are from the Diana’s Peak area, although Roxburgh also noted it from “the Sandy Bay range” (see Beatson 1816), presumably meaning that it was more widely distributed along the Central Ridge.","The wood was undoubtedly used for timber, but the harvest is unlikely to have been regular since the mid 19th Century as specimens have become increasingly scarce.",Terrestrial,"After the rediscovery of the single tree in 1977, an intensive rescue attempt was mounted in with expert help from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Jackson 1991).

A female ""soon to lay"" was collected in southern Fuerteventura in early April 1888, and a pair in breeding condition collected on Graciosa in early April 1890. The nest and eggs are undescribed. It diet is unknown but likely was predominantly mussels and limpets. The species is thought to have been resident (Hockey 1996).","Its decline was probably a result of overharvesting of intertidal invertebrates and disturbance by people (Hockey 1987), although predation by rats and cats has also been implicated (Collar and Stuart 1985).",The European and EU27 population is estimated to be extinct.,"","The species was endemic to Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and their offshore islets in the Canary Islands, Spain (Collar et al. 1994).

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer et al. 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler et al. 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower Ageratina riparia), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species Taudactylus diurnus (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards et al. (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines et al. 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.","","This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines et al. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999). It inhabited streams in the catchments of the Mary, Stanley and Mooloolah River (Ingram 1983).

This species experienced very rapid declines, from being relatively common to extinct at each known locality within just a year or so, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This species was a rainforest specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001), and found in upland rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest along fast-flowing streams where there is white water from riffles and cascades (Liem 1974, McDonald 1992). It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger et al. 1999).Richard et al. (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards et al. 1993). However, this species had apparently disappeared from sites on the Atherton Tableland much earlier (Richards et al. 1993). It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Trenerry et al. 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019). Gillespie et al. (2020) have now declared this species extinct.","","This Australian endemic species was distributed across two thirds of the Wet Tropics from Douglas Creek near Cardwell to Alexandra Creek, Thornton Peak in northeast Queensland (Hero and Fickling 1994) at altitudes between 380 and 1,020 m asl (McDonald 1992).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceThe habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988.

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards et al. (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards et al. 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger et al. 1999, Schloegel et al. 2006). Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards et al. 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards et al. 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards et al. 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero et al. 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero et al. 2002, Schloegel et al. 2006). Apart from these two individuals, it has not been recorded during extensive searches of suitable, known sites from the previous range of this species between 1994 and 2004 (Hero and McDonald, personal communication in Schloegel et al. 2006), and more recent extensive surveys in the region have still failed to find any individuals and it is now believed that this species is extinct (Conrad Hoskin pers. comm. 2016, Gillespie et al. 2020).","","This Australian endemic species was widely distributed from Mount Graham to the Big Tableland, in northeast Queensland, at altitudes of 300–1,300 m asl (McDonald 1992).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceIts historical range included Lumholtz, Wooroonooran, Daintree, Crater, Cedar Bay, and Tully Falls National Parks, as well as Qld Timber Reserve (165 Monkhouse), Lamb Range, Malbon Thompson Range, Herberton Range, Ravenshoe, Kirrama Range, Mt Fisher, Maalan, Mt Lewis, and Windsor State Forests (Tyler 1997). There was a captive-rearing programme run by the Melbourne Zoo and the Queensland Department of the Environment, that started in 1996.

In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm Archontophoenix cunninghamia, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (Lomandra longifolia, Carex neurochlamys, Elatostema reticulatum and Blechnum nudum) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with Lantana camara (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like Rheobatrachus silus, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines et al. 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). The species was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with Lantana camara or where the weeds Baccharis halimifolia and Ageratina riparia (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy et al. 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines et al. 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990). There is no information on population size, structure, genetics or dynamics (Hines et al. 1999).

None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19th century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.","","Rucervus schomburgki was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008).Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008).Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara et al. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996).

Some individuals remain in captive breeding facilities and a reintroduction plan is being developed.","It once inhabited dry to moist `ohi`a-koa forest and woodlands, but it later became confined to high mountain forest. It is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on the fruit of native understory plants (Maxfield 1998, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999). As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006). Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006). Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko et al. 2003).","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006). The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006). During breeding the species is sensitive to human disturbance (Faike 2006), including nest-monitoring operations (Banko et al. 2002, Walters 2006). Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose Herpestes javanicus and the native Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius (classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) and Toxoplasma gondii carried by feral cats (Banko et al. 2002, J. Burgett in litt. 2007, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Feral cats are ubiquitous in the species's habitat and are also potential predators (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko et al. 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009), and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006), could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in C. hawaiiensis, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow C. brachyrhynchos in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett in litt. 2007).","In 1992, there were only 11 or 12 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009), and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002. The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006). The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011).","","Corvus hawaiiensis was distributed historically on Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009). Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayBetween 1993 and 2007, over 90 birds were hatched in the captive breeding programme (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009). Captive-raised individuals were released into lightly-managed habitat and monitored (Kuehler et al. 1994, Lieberman 1997, Banko 2009), but releases were stopped after January 1999 due to increasing mortality (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Relocation of problematic B. solitarius failed because the birds homed back from over 32 km (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Two reintroduction sites have now been identified (Nelson in litt. 2012). Following ungulate removal, fencing and habitat restoration, reintroduction at Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve is due to begin with the release of 6 birds hatched in 2016. Ongoing restoration effort continues at the second site. A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009, outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation to minimize loss of genetic diversity, protecting suitable habitat and managing threats to the species, establishing new populations in managed habitat, establishing a program to increase public support, and continuing research and adaptive management practices for species recovery (USFWS 2009).

In captivity, the female lays two or three eggs per clutch. The age of youngest breeding female was two years (del Hoyo 1994).","The extinction of this species had been forecast since its discovery. Ceaseless clearance of its lowland forest habitat, chiefly for sugarcane, and poaching had soon brought it to the verge of extinction. Sugarcane demand increased dramatically in the late 1970s, owing to a government programme to increase fuel alcohol production, hastening the destruction of remaining habitat. Pesticide-use in cane fields surrounding extant forest may also have had a detrimental effect. The last remaining area of reasonably extensive lowland forest in the region was virtually entirely cleared within six months in the late 1980s, while continued hunting served only to exacerbate the species's decline. The captive population, which was established from only three individuals, has been undergoing a severe bottleneck with a drastic decrease in genetic diversity (Costa et al. 2017). However, despite the loss of genetic diversity and the subsequent hybridization with M. tuberosum, several purebred M. mitu have persisted throughout the 35 years of captive breeding (Costa et al. 2017).","A captive population was established in Rio de Janeiro in 1977.

In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba Dam in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River blocked the migration route, preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches to spawn. Juveniles were last recorded in the upper reaches of the river in 1992, suggesting that few individuals might have been able to survive and reproduce above the dam. The last individual was observed in 2003. Despite intense surveys, no remaining individuals have been detected and there is no chance that such a large and enigmatic species has survived unnoticed. Therefore, this species is now assessed as Extinct.","The Chinese Paddlefish was anadromous (spent at least part of its life in the estuary and the sea and migrated upriver to reproduce). The species occurred in the main stem of large rivers, staying usually in middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swimming into large lakes. Its spawning period was in March and April. Spawning sites were located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Available information also indicates that spawning took place in the lower Jinsha River between Shuifu and Yibin (Liu and Zeng 1988, Li et al. 1997). Psephurus gladius was a piscivorous species, and the largest individual recorded was 7 m in length and weighed over several thousand pounds.","The Chinese Paddlefish was heavily overfished. Even fry of Psephurus gladius, forming schools along the river, were easily captured in traditional Chinese fishing nets and set nets (Zhang et al. 2009). All age classes were taken whenever possible. Its long generation time (e.g. late sexual maturation and large size) made it very vulnerable to overharvest.In 1981 the Gezhouba Dam was built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, blocking the migration route and preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn. Due to early depletion of the stocks and the difficulties to keep it in aquaculture, no ex situ population was established.","The species is now extinct (Zhang et al. 2020). After the last finding of the species in 2003, the distribution area was surveyed intensively but without success and there have been also no reports or sightings from other waters. There is no hope that this large and enigmatic species might have survived unnoticed.From the mid-20th century the population of the Chinese Paddlefish decreased rapidly. Incidental capture data between 1982–2003 from the upper, mid and lower sections of the Yangtze indicate the largest number was found in 1985, when 32 individuals were captured in the lower section (below the Gezhouba Dam) (Zhang et al. 2009). In 1995 juveniles were recorded below the Gezhouba Dam of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007).Two juvenile individuals (1.2 kg weight, 47 cm total length; 1.3 kg weight, 50 cm total length) were still found in the Chongqing reach in 1992 (Chen 2007). In 2002, an adult female (body length 330 cm, weight 117 kg) was captured in the section of Jiangsu Nanjing of the Yangtze River. Urgent attempts were made to safeguard this individual, but it only survived for 30 days in captivity. On January 24th, 2003, another adult female (body length 352 cm) was accidentally caught in Yibin, Sichuan Province China (upper reach of Yangtze River). It was tagged with an ultra-sonic tag and released by Dr. Wei’s team from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences. Unfortunately, after 12 hours of tracking, communication was disconnected and contact with the fish got lost. Between 2006 and 2008, Dr. Wei’s team used a number of boats to deploy 4,762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering a stretch of 412.5 km of the upper Yangtze River attempting to catch the last remaining individuals, but failed to get a single one (Zhang et al. 2009). The team also used hydroacoustic equipment to survey the river, also without success (Zhang et al. 2009). Time of extinction was estimated to be by around 2005 and in any case no later than by 2010. The Chinese Paddlefish reached functional extinction in during the early 1990s (Zhang et al.2020).","","The Chinese Paddlefish was found in the Yangtze River in China. They spent part of their life in the lower section of the Yangtze, including the brackish estuary water, migrated upstream into the Yangtze for spawning, which occurred in Spring from mid-March to early April.

Some trees are preserved in ex situ collections, in botanic gardens and private collections. There have been some attempts to re-establish the species on the island, but so far they have been unsuccessful. ","In the past it grew in certain scattered areas of the island, preferably in low areas, on the north coast, Hanga Roa and Rano Kau, however its distribution before human colonization of the island has not been determined (Conaf 2011). Some palynological studies have shown that the island used to be covered with shrub and woodlands (Bahn and Flenley 1992). Due to its extinction in the wild there is not further information about its ecology, for example there is no knowledge about pollination ecology or symbionts (Maunder et al. 2000).","The main threat in the past was the logging of the trees, since their wood was used for carving, and the degradation of the island's natural scrub and woodland ecosystems (Conaf 2011). At present, threats to the native habitat are: damage caused by livestock and possible hybridization with other species of the genus Sophora (such as S. macrocarpa). There is also evidence of the damage caused by insects and pests (Maunder et al. 2000).","The last wild specimen was a plant in Rano Kao in 1935, it was chopped down in 1960 (Lucas and Synge 1978).","","This species is native to Rapa Nui island, from where it is endemic, however, there are no trees left in the wild.

However, these preliminary trials for the propagation of this species have not been successful in re-establishing the species (CONAF 2011). In the last few attempts of reintroduction, it has been possible to identify possible causes of lack of success: lack of nitrifying bacteria in the local soil, increased pests on the island, weakness of the offspring of a last specimen that was probably growing in a marginal site of distribution of the species, or a combination of all of them. For successful management, based on previous experience, it is necessary to locate all Toromiro trees, confirm their taxonomic identity and assessment of genetic diversity (Maunder et al. 2000).",Oceanian,1960,false,false,Global

Breeding occurred during the austral summer. Two or three eggs were laid in the wild (up to five in captivity). The wild bird and the P. maracana apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid.","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros et. al. 2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros et. al. 2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart et. al. 2018).,"","This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil.

However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw Propyrrhura maracana, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female C. spixii was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line (Caparroz et al. 2001).

However, it declined rapidly between 1975 and 1985, predominantly due to invasive species and disease. By mid-1997 only three individuals remained. One was captured in 2004, but it died later that year. The other two individuals have not been reported since 2003 and 2004, with no others reported despite intensive surveys. A set of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) laid out methods for quantitatively estimating a species’s probability of extinction based on parameters associated with threats, in addition to records and surveys. Based on the application of these methods (Butchart et al. 2018), this species is regarded as extinct.","It was found in remote `ohi`a forest (T. Pratt in litt. 1999) at 1,400-2,100 m, but this may be suboptimal habitat as subfossil evidence indicates that it occurred in much drier habitat at 300-1,500 m (Mountainspring et al. 1990, Reilly 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999). It fed primarily on snails, insects and spiders, and occasionally fruit (Pratt et al. 1997, M. Collins in litt. 1999). The two known nests were found in `ohi`a trees (Pratt et al. 1997).","Habitat destruction and modification, and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines (Mountainspring et al. 1990, T. Pratt in litt. 1999). The precise causes of the recent population decline are unknown (Rosa et al. 1998), although a correlation with a concurrent 473% increase in pig activity within the Hanawi NAR has been hypothesised, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance (Mountainspring et al. 1990). Predation by introduced rats, cats and small Indian mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus is also possible. Rats and the introduced garlic snail (Oxychilus alliarius) have been blamed for the decline of native land snails, an important food source for the Poo-uli (Groombridge et al. 2004).",One of the last three known individuals died in captivity in 2004. The other two have not been seen since 2003 and 2004 respectively. No new individuals have been found since 1998 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006).,"","Melamprosops phaeosoma was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where it was discovered in 1973 in the Ko`olau Forest Reserve on the north-eastern flanks of Haleakala (Pratt et al. 1997, Rosa et al. 1998), and estimated to number fewer than 200 birds. During 1975-1985, there was a rapid decline in density in the upper Hanawi watershed (Mountainspring et al. 1990), the last area from which it was known. In 1995, only five to seven birds were known but, by mid-1997, only three individuals could be found (two male, one possibly female), each with distinct home ranges in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and the immediately adjacent Haleakala National Park (Baker 2001). One of three known individuals (male) was captured in September 2004 but died on 28 November 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006, VanderWerf et al. 2006). The two other individuals may both have been male, but neither have been seen since 2003 and 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006) and are likely to have now died (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006). No other individuals have been located since 1998 despite almost constant presence of researchers in the field in recent years (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn 1986, the 30 km2 Hanawi NAR was created to protect this species and, during 1990-1997, all feral pigs were systematically eradicated from three fenced areas (Anderson and Stone 1993, Pratt et al. 1997, Reilly 1998, Rosa et al. 1998). In 2006, the East Maui Watershed Partnership (EMWP) completed a c.5000 ha fenced unit adjacent to and east of Hanawi NAR incorporating the Ko'olau Forest Preserve, Haiku Uka and Waikamoi Forest Preserve, between about 1,000 m and 2,400 m elevation. Feral ungulate control was completed by 2012, although continued maintenance and ungulate surveys continue regularly.Two wild birds were briefly united when one was caught and moved into the home range of another. However, after just one day the translocated bird had returned to its own territory (Groombridge et al. 2004). One of three known individuals was captured in September 2004, but died in captivity on 28 November 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006). The 2006 East Maui Forest Bird Survey covered 216 stations on eight transects within Poo-uli habitat, and failed to locate any birds.An environmental assessment has been produced and a management plan was proposed (USFWS and Hawai`i DLNR 1999, Groombridge et al. 2004). Conservation Actions ProposedThe Hanawi Natural Area Reserve provides crucial habitat for other rare Hawaiian birds, but, given that it is considered extinct, no conservation actions specific to this species are proposed. ",Oceanian,2004,false,false,Global

Birds have been found singly, in pairs or small groups, and often joined mixed-species flocks. Food was gleaned from leaves, bark, crevices and debris, and consisted of insects, including larvae taken from dead wood, beetles, grasshoppers and ants.

It was a highly terrestrial frugivore, and probably depended on an intact understorey of ferns and euphorbias.","The decline and extinction in the wild of this species has been attributed chiefly to predation by cats. However, it was thought that cats became feral on Socorro in the 1950s, but this date has now been revised to the early 1970s (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000). This suggests that other factors, such as human predation (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003) and high levels of understorey grazing by sheep, may have been significant. Outbreaks of a permanent locust Schistocerca piceifrons swarm have occurred twice a year since 1994, resulting in damage to the leaves, flowers and fruit of indigenous forests, with at least 30 ha lost to defoliation so far, thus reducing the extent of prime habitat for the species (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). Locust outbreaks may be favoured by the habitat degradation caused by introduced species (Song et al. 2006).","Fortunately, aviculture has prevented the extinction of the species, with captive populations held in around 30 institutions in the U.S.A., Europe and Mexico, with at least 70 institutions participating at some point in the captive breeding efforts since 1994 (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). The European breeding programme for this endangered species has monitored the captive population for more than 30 years (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). The captive population was thought to total several hundred birds, but hybridisation with Mourning Doves Z. macroura became a major problem in the U.S.A. in the 1990s (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003), and it now appears that many of these U.S. birds are hybrids (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). As a consequence of the occurrence of avian influenza in Europe in 2006, the Socorro Dove Project sent a total of 12 birds to Albuquerque Biological Park to form a second, independent reserve population nearer to the species's native country (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). The total captive population is currently estimated at approximately 150 individuals (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). In 2013 and again in 2014 a number of birds were transferred to Mexico to form a national captive breeding flock ahead of efforts to eventually return the species to Socorro Island (H. Horblit in litt. 2013, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016).","","This species has been extirpated from Socorro in the Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico. It was formerly common and observations in 1957 and 1958 gave no indication that it was declining. The last sighting in the wild was in 1972 (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996), and all suitable habitat on the island has been surveyed subsequently without recording the dove (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000). Several individuals were taken during an expedition to the islands in 1925 and subsequently bred in the U.S.A., with some sent to Europe (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Revillagigedo Islands were declared a biosphere reserve in 1994 (Stattersfield et al. 1998, Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria recognised a breeding programme for the species, as initiated by Cologne and Frankfurt zoos (Germany) and the private interest group Wild Pigeons and Doves, as an official European Endangered species programme (EEP), in 1995 (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). Modern studbook software has been employed to assist with the genetic and demographic management of the captive population. Individuals have been distributed to zoos and bird parks in countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, U.K., Poland, Austria, Luxembourg, France, Spain, the Czech Republic and Germany (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2007, 2012). Of 672 individuals listed in the studbook by December 2010, 102 were known to be alive (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Since 2006, following an extensive survey of the origin of the founding individuals of the EEP population, major software-based population genetic analyses have been conducted and recommendations for new pairs have been given by the EEP coordinator (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2007, 2012). A special breeding unit for the species has been opened at Marlow Bird Park, Germany (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). A proposal has been developed to reintroduce the species (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996, Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012), along with a restoration programme for Socorro (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Horblit et al. 2006). DNA fingerprinting has revealed extensive hybridisation with Z. macroura in the U.S.A., however it also showed a high degree of relatedness between the European population and pure individuals kept in California (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). As a result, the European population will be used for reintroduction efforts. The construction of breeding aviaries on Socorro began in August 2003 (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003) and was completed by 2005 (Bell et al. 2005a). Resident populations of Z. macroura and Common Ground-dove Columbina passerina (Bell et al. 2005a) were screened in December 2003 and January 2004 to assess the presence of pathogens that might affect the reintroduction programme (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Bell et al. 2005a, b). Avian malaria and trichomoniasis were detected in both species, and as a result recommendations were put forward (Bell et al. 2005a, b). In 2005, plans were outlined to control the locust outbreaks, restore native vegetation and assess the problem of erosion (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005). The arrival on Socorro of the first birds from the EEP was planned for June 2005 (Bell et al. 2005b), with the establishment of a breeding flock by June 2006 (Bell et al. 2005a, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). However, there have been problems with import restrictions and permits (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). In the face of these restrictions a small insurance population was established in the U.S.A. in 2008 (H. Horblit in litt. 2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007), forming the basis for the return of the species to Africam Safari Zoo, Puebla, Mexico (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Two groups of birds were transferred to Mexico in 2013 and 2014 to form the basis of a population for eventual reintroduction to Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). Control of feral cats has been undertaken on Socorro ( B. Tershy in litt. 1999) although despite over over five hundred cats being killed on the island between 2011-2016, they still persist throughout the island in low numbers (B. Tershy in litt. 2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016, Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2017, Lowen 2020). Furthermore, over 1,700 feral sheep were culled on the island between 2009-2012 (Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2016) and as of 2012, sheep were completely eradicated from the island, facilitating a rapid, remarkable recovery in local vegetation cover (Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2017, Lowen 2020). Reports that rats have recently colonised Socorro have proved to be unfounded (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000) although mice remain an issue on the island and must be removed due to their predation of dove chicks (J. Lowen in litt. 2020). Techniques to grow four endemic tree species from Socorro have been successful, with 117 tree seedlings planted on the island. These restored areas will be important when birds are eventually released back onto Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). The species is included on the 'Watch List' of the State of North America's Birds as a species of high conservation concern (NABCI 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedImport birds from the EEP and establish a breeding flock on Socorro (Bell et al. 2005a, b, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Complete the eradication of cats and sheep on Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005, 2007). Continue to restore native vegetation on Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005). Reintroduce the species following satisfactory progress in mammal eradication (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005, 2007) and habitat restoration programmes (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Horblit et al. 2006, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005).

Multiple methods for determining the likelihood of extinction have used the sighting history of this species as a test dataset and each has determined that the species is extinct beyond reasonable doubt. The probability of the species being extinct from these models first exceeded 95% during the period between 1989 and the start of 2005. Separately, an expert-led assessment of the probability of extinction based on the severity and spatial extent of threats concluded there was 90% probability that it was extinct. Considering the last confirmed sighting of the species was in 1985 despite adequate survey of remaining habitat within the potential range, and in view of the threats to the species, its lack of mobility and restricted range, this species is considered to be Extinct.","Behaviour This species was presumed to be strongly sedentary since its small wings render it unable to fly long distances. Some movements to highland lakes and ponds other than Lake Alaotra were thought to have occurred as a result of the degradation of its preferred habitat, as opposed to representing habitual movement (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It was usually found in pairs, sometimes in association with T. ruficollis (Langrand 1990). It was thought to have a flexible breeding season, with historical records of breeding in April-June and in January-March (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat Lake Alaotra is a large, shallow, brackish lake. Its shores were historically covered with dense vegetation including papyrus and reeds, which may have been important for this species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet It fed almost exclusively on fish (Langrand 1990). Breeding site Nothing was known of its breeding ecology (Langrand 1990).","Several major factors contributed to this species' extinction. The primary driver of the rapid population reduction and loss of most individuals is considered to be the introduction of the carnivorous fish Micropterus salmoides and Channa striata (ZICOMA 1999), which caused adult mortality but more significantly reduced reproduction to near-zero. These fish were introduced to the Alaotra basin in the 1950s and very rapid population declines appear to have commenced shortly afterwards. Additional introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially Tilapia, probably depleted essential foods for the species (Pidgeon 1996). Conversion of natural habitat for agriculture also occurred at an increasing rate during this time, with deforestation resulting in sedimentation from soil erosion and water quality being lowered, and considerable area has been converted to rice farms (Wilmé 1994). The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra proliferated more recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared (Hawkins et al. 2000). The final few individuals may have been lost through hybridisation with T. ruficollis, although this appears to have been occurring for a long time as the type series from 1932 includes a presumed hybrid (Delacour 1932, Collar and Stuart 1985, Hawkins et al. 2000). Poaching may also have played a role in the extinction of the species (Wilmé 1994), although larger-bodied waterbirds are thought to have always been the primary target of hunters (Hawkins et al. 2000).","The species was described in 1932 from Lake Alaotra (Delacour 1932) and in 1960 grebe flocks on the lake contained c. 50 individuals alongside Little Grebe T. ruficollis and Madagascar Little Grebe T. pelzelnii, but also a number of hybrids with T. ruficollis (Voous and Payne 1965, Collar and Stuart 1985). Thirteen specimens were collected at this time (Voous and Payne 1965), presumably out of the total of 50 (Hawkins et al. 2000). Numerous other reports from a wider area are given in Collar and Stuart (1985), but none were documented and were subsequently considered to be in error for T. pelzelnii. In 1982 c. 12 individuals were identified as still present, along with several hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Two or three individuals were then recorded in 1985 near Andreba on Lake Alaotra, when the only known photographs of the species in the wild was taken (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson. in litt. 2022). There have been no further confirmed sightings despite considerable survey effort (Hawkins et al. 2000). The sighting series for the species has been used in the development of models to determine extinction probability using both linear modelling and Bayesian approaches (Lee et al. 2014, Thompson et al. 2017, 2019): these all conclude the species became extinct prior to 1995. Separately, an assessment of the likely impact of the combination of threats faced by the species concluded that the severity and extent indicated a 90% probability of extinction for the species (Keith et al. 2017).","","Tachybaptus rufolavatus was endemic to Madagascar and known chiefly from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999). There have been no confirmed sightings since 1985 when two were seen (in addition to several apparent hybrids) near Andreba on Lake Alaotra in September 1985 (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson in litt. 2022). After this an adult and an immature were reported as the species in 1986 (B. Dawson, unpublished report) and two individuals (also an adult and an immature) which may have been Alaotra Grebe were again reported in 1988 (D. Thorn, unpublished report) but these were not documented and may have been hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Survey visits to Lake Alaotra in 1989-90 (Young and Smith 1989, Wilmé 1994) 1993 and 1994 (Pidgeon 1996), then 1997-1999 failed to produce any sightings, prompting a targeted survey in 1999 which only located four T. pelzelnii (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Visits in 2000 found no individuals (of this or any species of Tachybaptus) on Lake Alaotra or surrounding lakes, and further surveys drew blanks in 2004 and 2009 (H. G. Young in litt. 2009). Records outside the Lake Alaotra region were unreliable as species was probably incapable of prolonged flight, so in all likelihood never occurred very far from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Checks of additional potential sites, in particular Lake Amparihinandriamabavy (F. Hawkins in litt. 2009), have failed to find any grebes. It is now considered extinct, as no suitable wetlands remain unsurveyed in the Alaotra region (H. G. Young in litt. 2009).","Some deliberate take of the species for food has been reported (Wilmé 1994), although larger waterbirds were more likely targets than the much smaller bodied grebes (Hawkins et al. 2000).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"",Afrotropical,1985,false,false,Global
209512755,103823664,Hemignathus affinis,Extinct,,2024,2024-02-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that the species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.94, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.91. Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, H. affinis was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","Hemignathus affinis inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000 m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott et al. 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to H. hanapepe in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Conant et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 1995). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for H. affinis and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa Akialoa lanaiensis, that occupied somewhat similar niches to H. affinis, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.","After no sightings for more than 60 years, Hemignathus affinis was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of Chlorodrepanis virens and possibly Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.91, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct. In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. affinis from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","","Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that H. affinis was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where G. floridana was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover G. floridana have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann et al. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by Thompson et al. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the  Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable. See attached Supplementary Information document for further details.",Govenia floridana is a terrestrial orchid that grew in deep hummus on the forest floor of heavily shaded tropical hardwood hammock habitat in Everglades National Park. It was reported to flower between November and December (Luer 1972).,"Poaching and trampling of the site by collectors may have contributed to this orchid’s decline and eventual disappearance from its only known locality (Gann 2015). In 1960 Hurricane Donna significantly altered conditions in the single hardwood hammock where this species occurred, increasing light penetration to the forest floor and causing an increase in understory vegetation. Altered conditions did not appear to have an immediate impact on the population of Govenia floridana, but may have contributed to its decline (Luer 1972). Long Pine Key, where this orchid was located, is protected within Everglades National Park. However, development and habitat degradation in South Florida has resulted in the loss of most potentially suitable hardwood hammock habitat outside the park (Loope and Avery 1979). ","When discovered in 1957, the only known population of Govenia floridana consisted of 25 individuals.

Extensive surveys have failed to find other tortoises on Pinta or in any of the world’s zoos. Tortoises with up to 50% abingdonii genes have been reported from Volcán Wolf on northern Isabela, including first generation hybrids, but no pure individuals of abingdonii are known to exist (TEWG, 2015). This assessment incorporates contributions from the international workshop on Galápagos tortoises convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate in July 2012.","Chelonoidis abingdonii was a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on higher vegetation, in particular, low-hanging cactus pads. Pinta habitat, before its destruction by feral goats, was largely dry xeric brushland and grassland at lower elevations, with limited more mesic forest habitat at higher elevations. Opuntia cactus trees are dominant in much of the Arid and Transition Zones on the island and provide an important food resource for tortoises. Habitats are now recovering following goat eradication.","Chelonoidis abingdonii was heavily exploited by whalers and other mariners in the 19th century as on-board food supplies, which severely depleted the population. By the 20th century, few tortoises remained and some exploitation continued by local fishermen. In addition, extensive deforestation by goats, introduced to Pinta in 1959, destroyed tortoise habitat (Pritchard 1996).","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-impact population was estimated to have been about 2,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). The Pinta Giant Tortoise was heavily exploited and its population collapsed in the middle of the 19th century, followed by significant collecting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploitation by local fishermen subsequently. The last surviving animal, Lonesome George, was collected from the wild in 1972 and transferred to the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, where he died on 24 June 2012. No further animals have been found on Pinta despite extensive surveys (Pritchard 1996). During the final goat eradication project (1998-2003), park ranger activity covered the island and yielded no sign of tortoises. In 2008, the Galápagos National Park Directorate carried out the last massive search for tortoises, but only found a few tortoise shells at the bottom of crevices (Cayot 2014).","","Chelonoidis abingdonii occurred on Pinta [formerly Abingdon Island] in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. Pinta has a total surface area of 59.4 sq.km, of which 24.5 sq. km / 41% could potentially sustain tortoises (Gibbs, unpubl. data).",Chelonoidis abingdonii was historically exploited in the 19th century by whalers and other mariners as on-board food supplies.,Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulations: Chelonoidis abingdonii is protected under Ecuadorian national law.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone 2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996). A recent five-day survey of Santa Luzia failed to recover evidence of a surviving population (Miralles et al. 2011, Vasconcelos et al. 2013), and these authors likewise concluded that this skink is now extinct. The most recent record of this species was a mandible of a juvenile collected from cat faeces on Santa Luzia in 2005, since when the cat population has increased and the invasive animals are now widespread on the island (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). Repeated surveys of Branco and Raso since this species was last recorded have also failed to rediscover it.","","This species was endemic to the Cape Verde islands, where it had been recorded from the islets Branco and Raso (Schleich 1987, Bocage 1873). These islands have a combined area less than 10.7 km². Its area of occupancy would have been an estimated 7 km² (Vasconcelos et al. 2013).

Intensive, generally unregulated fishing was likely the major threat resulting in the depletion of the Java Stingaree population, with coastal fisheries catches already declining in the 1870s. Catches on the northern coast of Java in 1940 were down to almost half the annual catch landed in the 1860s. Additionally, the northern coast of Java, particularly Jakarta Bay, is heavily industrialized, and extensive habitat loss and degradation may also have impacted this species. Coastal habitats likely utilized by the Java Stingaree have been replaced with aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s. The life history of the Java Stingaree is not known, however urolophids are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (as low as 1–2 pups/year). The species was therefore likely highly susceptible to population reduction and depletion. Despite extensive survey efforts since 2001 including monitoring of fish landing sites along the northern coast of Java (including Jakarta), as well as elsewhere in Indonesia, no further specimens have been recorded. Previously assessed in 2021 as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (CR(PE)), a reassessment has been undertaken with further information on threats and survey effort.The Framework for using the Threats Model and the Records and Surveys Model to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction, and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species, were both extremely high. The Java Sea and surrounding waters have a long history of fisheries development and fishing effort has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985. The probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.00). There have been no planned species-specific surveys, but there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of sharks and rays in general in Java since 2001. It is highly likely that these surveys would have recorded the species if it were present given the Java Stingaree’s uniqueness within the Java Sea region and surrounds. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.97 (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). Both model results are &gt;0.9 and therefore the Java Stingaree meets the threshold for the Extinct category.","The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype, a female of 33.8 cm total length (TL)/19.1 cm disc width (DW) collected from a fish market in Jakarta, Indonesia (Martens 1864). The size of this specimen falls within the known range of female size-at-maturity for urolophids (20–50 cm TL across nine species; Last et al. 2016), and therefore maturity of the holotype cannot be inferred. Its previous habitat is unknown, however stingarees generally inhabit waters of the continental and insular shelves while a few species occur in deeper slope waters to 430 m depth (Last et al. 2016). The Java Sea is relatively flat (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) and this topography offers relatively little variability in habitats available to species in this region.The life history of the species is unknown, but urolophids have some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays, with five studied species producing 1–2 pups per year (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). Urolophids reproduce annually or biennially, with long gestation lengths of at least 10–12 months and up to 19 months (Last et al. 2016). Urolophid embryos are also readily aborted upon capture (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016), indicating a reduction in reproductive potential in heavily fished regions even if released alive after capture. The Java Stingaree is therefore likely to have had limited resilience to overexploitation.","Demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia for decades (Stobutzki et al. 2006), if not consistently since the 1870s when declines were first reported (Yuwono 2001). Indonesia has also been the world’s largest shark and ray producer and exporter of fins and meat since 1998, and ranked among the top 20 shark fishing nations since 1980 (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo et al. 2021). Sharks and rays are captured and retained in targeted fisheries and as bycatch across Indonesia (White and Dharmadi 2007, Booth et al. 2018, Clark-Shen et al. 2022). The historical range of the Java Stingaree is subject to intense inshore fishing pressure, which is largely unregulated, and the relatively shallow waters of the Java Sea (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) provide no refuge at depth. The Java Sea demersal coastal fishery catch was declining by the end of the 1800s (Yuwono 2001), and from 1976 to 1997 the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings (Blaber et al. 2009). Total fishing effort in Indonesia has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985 (Squires et al. 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). Despite this, until recently fisheries policies aimed to increase fishing capacity, causing declines in stocks and catch rates of sharks and rays throughout Indonesia (Squires et al. 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). The Java Sea is currently Indonesia’s second largest Fisheries Management Area in terms of catch (tonnes) and produces significantly higher ray landings than sharks (Prasetyo et al. 2021). Ray species of the family Dasyatidae make up the majority of ray catches in Indonesia (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi et al. 2009, Booth et al. 2018, Prasetyo et al. 2021), many of which would be predicted to occupy the same habitats and interact with the same fishing gears as the Java Stingaree. Rays are captured and usually retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries in Indonesia which use a range of fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook-and-line, trap, and seine net (White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber et al. 2009, Dharmadi et al. 2015). The high market value of many shark and ray products, particularly fins, makes targeted fishing a profitable venture, and fishers are incentivized to retain sharks and rays (Booth et al. 2018, D’Alberto et al. 2022).Shallow inshore waters around the Indo-Malay Archipelago are also threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki et al. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). Approximately 90% of Jakarta Bay’s shoreline has been modified for development, including urban, industrial, agricultural, or aquaculture purposes (Bengen et al. 2006), with the destruction of mangrove habitats for aquaculture ponds beginning in the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). In Jakarta, services and infrastructure such as sewage and wastewater treatment plants are not capable of facilitating the whole human population, leading to pollution of waterways surrounding the megacity (Dsikowitzky et al. 2016). As a result, coastal ecosystems of the heavily industrialized Jakarta Bay are significantly degraded through habitat loss (including the Jakarta Reclamation Project), increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination which has resulted in mercury bioaccumulation in rays in Jakarta Bay (see Hosono et al. 2011 and references within; Budiyanto et al. 2015). Coastal habitats have also undergone degradation as a result of destructive fishing practices (Booth et al. 2018). Species occurring in small geographic ranges are generally more sensitive to threatening processes (Joppa et al. 2016), and the stressors on the aquatic environment surrounding the growing Jakarta region are intense and ever-increasing.","The only known Java Stingaree specimen was a female collected in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1862, and since then considerable survey effort in Indonesia, particularly since 2001, has failed to locate further specimens. Extensive surveys of landing sites and fish markets have been conducted in Indonesia (e.g., Adrim and Fahmi 2007, White and Dharmadi 2007, Fahmi et al. 2008, Fahmi 2012, Ernawati et al. 2015, Tirtadanu et al. 2018, Simeon et al. 2017, Simeon et al. 2018, Simeon et al. 2021, Yuwandana et al. 2019). Shark and ray catches at Indonesian landing sites are also continually monitored by trained government agencies and non-governmental organizations (e.g., Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center [SEAFDEC], Rekam Nusantara Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Society [WCS]) and no contemporary specimens, photographs, or genetic evidence of the species have been found. Despite &gt;28,000 individual rays being examined in Indonesian landing sites (including Jakarta) between 2001 and 2006 (White and Dharmadi 2007), and extensive surveys in Indonesia (including the Java Sea region) between 2007 and 2022, the Java Stingaree has not been recorded (Supplementary Information). The majority of ray catch at major landing sites is made up of rays from the family Dasyatidae (White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi et al. 2009, Booth et al. 2018, Prasetyo et al. 2021). This includes individuals as small as 9.1 cm disc width (DW) (Hemitrygon longicauda [referred to as Dasyatis sp. 1]) and 9.2 cm DW (Telatrygon biasa [Dasyatis zugei], Brevitrygon javaensis [Himantura cf. walga]) (White and Dharmadi 2007). Because even low-value products are landed for markets such as salted or smoked meat, fishmeal, and pet food, it is very likely that, if extant, further Java Stingaree specimens would have been taken to landing sites if captured and subsequently recorded by observers. The species was also not recorded in trawl surveys in the Java Sea at depths of 15–70 m in 2015 and 2017, which recorded several species of rays, also dominated by stingrays of the family Dasyatidae (Ernawati et al. 2015, Tirtadanu et al. 2018).Since the only Java Stingaree specimen was collected at a fish market, the species’ geographic range limits and habitat have not been defined. Most other urolophid species have restricted geographic ranges and/or are restricted to a single country (see Last et al. 2016). A restricted range is assumed for the Java Stingaree due to a lack of records from adjacent islands which are also monitored and the general pattern of small geographic range size in this family. In the 1860s, fishers were limited by fishing technology and the size and facilities of their fishing vessels. Javan fishing vessels were too small to provide spaces for catch to be preserved or salted onboard, so fishers generally remained within 40 km of the coastline, and it is likely that fishing grounds worked from Jakarta in the late 1800s did not exceed more than one-third of the Java Sea (Yuwono 2001). The Java Stingaree holotype was collected as a fresh specimen at a landing site (Martens 1864) and was therefore likely collected within 40 km seaward of Jakarta. It is unlikely that the species was restricted to an area as small as Jakarta Bay, but it is reasonable to assume it may have been restricted to the Java Sea. Therefore, for this assessment, the threats and surveys that encompass the Java Sea and the northern coast of Java were considered.The Framework (Akçakaya et al. 2017) for using the Threats Model (Keith et al. 2017) and the Records and Surveys Model (Thompson et al. 2017) to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The Models were developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be applied under a range of possible scenarios including to calculate the probability of extinction (P(E)) for rare species with a limited number of records over an observed time series. The Threats Model considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the species’ life history characteristics to determine the probability that a species is extinct (Keith et al. 2017). Indonesia represents the world’s largest shark fishing nation by catch (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo et al. 2021). Fisheries in Java have a long history, with the first reports of coastal fishery resources becoming depleted by the late 1800s (Yuwono 2001). Unregulated small-scale fisheries and large-scale commercial trawls since the 1970s have driven recent overexploitation in the region, and the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings from 1976 to 1997 (Blaber et al. 2009). There are numerous large fishing ports and landing sites in Java, and local depletion of shark and ray resources in the Java Sea have led local fishers to access resources further afield (e.g., Kalimantan, Papua). Java is the world’s most populated island with a population of over 140 million people, the majority of which are located on the northern coast of Java. Jakarta is a growing megacity with intense levels of human pressure on coastal habitats and resources. Jakarta Bay is heavily industrialized and coastal ecosystems are significantly degraded through habitat loss, increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination. Mangrove habitats have been replaced with industrial areas, urban areas, and aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). Further habitat destruction has resulted from government policy, namely the Reclamation Policy of 1995 and the subsequent Jakarta Reclamation Project beginning in 2015.The life history of the Java Stingaree is unknown, however urolophids are well-studied and are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). Gestation length is considered relatively long, spanning at least 10–12 months (Last et al. 2016), and reproductive potential is considered low (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). The species is therefore considered highly susceptible to population decline as a result of threats. Consequently, the probability that the combination of threats affecting the Java Stingaree occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction P(local) and the probability that the threats occurred over the entire range of the species P(spatial) were both extremely high (minimum = 0.90; best = 0.95; maximum = 1.0). As a result, the probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 or 90% (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.0).The Records and Surveys Model estimates the probability that a species is extinct based on a time series of known records of the species, and the timing, extent, and species-specific adequacy of surveys (Thompson et al. 2017). The species is known from a single record, the holotype collected in 1862. p(ci) (the probability that the species was correctly identified as extant) was therefore set at 1 (lower; best; upper) as per guidelines in the Instructions (see the Instructions document on the IUCN Red List website). The proportion of the species’ range covered by passive surveys (epsilon) was set at a moderate level (epsilon: lower = 0.4; best = 0.5; upper = 0.6) due to the restricted range of the species and extensive coverage by fishers who fish daily and usually land catches locally. The probability that the species would have been recorded (p(r)) or reliably identified (p(i)) in passive surveys was low (p(r): lower = 0.1; best = 0.15; upper = 0.2; p(i): lower = 0; best = 0.1; upper = 0.2) due to the rarity, small-size, and low economic value of the Java Stingaree, and lack of species-level knowledge held by fishers, as per the Instructions.There have been no surveys targeted specifically at locating further specimens of this species, however, there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of elasmobranchs in general in Java, and it is highly likely that these surveys would have documented the presence of the Java Stingaree if it had been caught. It is worth noting that these surveys have recorded many rare species, including many rare ray species (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007). An intensive focus on survey effort for elasmobranchs commenced in 2001 (see White and Dharmadi 2007) and some form of survey in West Java, Central Java, Jakarta, and/or the Java Sea has taken place near annually since (Supplementary Information). Monitoring landing sites is a standard approach to surveying fishes in Asia and is very effective for documenting catches and species given the pooling of ‘samples’ at one location. Landing site surveys in Indonesia since 2001 have resulted in the description of over 20 new shark and ray species (White et al. 2006). Landing site surveys are likely to have included catch from throughout the likely depth range of the Java Stingaree. Prior to 2001, there had been little dedicated survey effort since the early ichthyological expeditions of the 1800s (see White et al. 2006). Surveys that occurred in Jakarta, the Java Sea, or the northern coast of West Java and Central Java were included in the Records and Surveys Model, while surveys in the same area examining landings from fisheries unlikely to interact with the Java Stingaree (e.g., pelagic longlines) were excluded. Pelagic longlines, for example, are unlikely to capture demersal species such as urolophids because they are not bottom-set.The proportion of the species’ range that was covered by dedicated surveys varied each year, with an average best value of 0.46 (epsilon best ranging from 0.15–0.9). The proportion of geographic range surveyed was increased for some years from the previous assessment (Kyne et al. 2021), taking into account the number of landing sites surveyed for that year and any fisheries-independent surveys. Since landing site surveys in Jakarta and Java more broadly monitor catches arriving from throughout the Java Sea and adjacent waters (Fahmi pers. obs. 2021), the proportion of the species’ geographic range surveyed is higher in years with multiple landing site surveys. Javan fishers may possibly land their catches outside of this area, and although not included in surveys for this assessment, these landing sites have also not recorded another Java Stingaree individual.The probability that the Java Stingaree would have been recorded in these surveys (p(r)) was set with a best value of 0.3 each year (lower = 0.2; upper = 0.4) following the suggested default values given in the Instructions for rare species (see Table 3 in the Instructions document). The probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the survey if it were recorded (p(i)) was set with a best value of 0.8 each year (lower = 0.7; upper = 0.9) based on the Instructions for species that are not particularly difficult to identify or distinguish from similar species, and that were searched for by seemingly competent surveyors (see Table 4 in the Instructions document). These values were chosen based on the Instructions because the species is the sole member of the family Urolophidae occurring in Java; the only other species in Indonesia is the Kai Stingaree (Urolophus kaianus) from far eastern Indonesia (Last et al. 2016). Although the stingray fauna (family Dasyatidae) is diverse in Indonesia, misidentification by trained surveyors is unlikely to have occurred as urolophids are easily distinguishable from dasyatids due to their short tails with an obvious elongate lobe-like caudal fin (Last et al. 2016).The probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Records and Surveys Model is 0.97, or 97% (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). The overall probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct in 2023 is the average of the results for both Models, which is 0.94 or 94%. The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.93 for both weighting methods. The Models also separately calculate the probability that the species is extant (P(Xt)) each year over the observation period (1862–2023). The probability that the Java Stingaree is extant in 2023 is 0.03 or 3%. Both model results are &gt;0.9, and therefore fall within the threshold for the Extinct category.This species has been reassessed due to expert opinion of the assessors that some of the parameters used in the previous assessment were set too low. The parameters which were changed from the previous assessment (Kyne et al. 2021) were P(local), P(spatial), and epsilon for dedicated surveys. The assessors each determined their best estimates for the extent and duration of threats (P(local) and P(spatial)) occurring throughout the Java Sea, and these individual estimates were used to determine the best estimates for this assessment. The proportion of geographic range surveyed (epsilon) was also increased for some of the survey years. This was based on consideration of the often very large geographic areas used by fishers delivering catches to landing sites. The estimates of epsilon for this assessment were therefore made by considering the number of landing sites surveyed in a particular year, and whether any fisheries-independent surveys also occurred in that year. Given that the geographic range of the Java Stingaree could have been restricted to a portion of the Java Sea (rather than the entire Java Sea as used in this assessment), the approach that was used to estimate epsilon is considered conservative. This reassessment also included updated recent survey effort for the years 2021 and 2022.For further information, see the Supplementary Information.","","The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia in the Western Central Pacific (Martens 1864, Last et al. 2016). The full geographic extent of the species’ historical range is uncertain, but the Java Stingaree was presumed to have had a relatively restricted distribution in the Java Sea due to a lack of records in surrounding areas. Further, the capability of fishing vessels in the 1800s (Yuwono 2001) indicate that the holotype was likely collected within 40 km of Jakarta’s shoreline.","Rays are heavily exploited and utilized in Indonesia, and are caught and retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries for their meat and skin (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber et al. 2009, Dharmadi et al. 2015, Booth et al. 2018, D’Alberto et al. 2022). As the only known specimen was collected from a fish market (Martens 1864), the species is likely to have been utilized when caught. The meat of small, lower value species is often consumed in coastal communities as salted or smoked fish (Booth et al. 2018). There is a demand for ray meat on the northern coast of Java due to the growing human population, with smoked rays popular in cities along the coast (B. Simeon pers. obs. 2023). Low value fishes can also be utilized as fishmeal or pet food.",Marine,"There are no species-specific measures implemented for the management or conservation of this species in Indonesia. Current legal and regulatory frameworks in Indonesia are considered insufficient to manage exploitation of sharks and rays within sustainable limits (Booth et al. 2018). Although some rays, including the Kai Stingaree (Urolophus kaianus) recently became protected under Minister Decree 1/2021, there has been no enforcement (B. Simeon pers. obs. 2023) and there are no current management or conservation actions related to artisanal ray fisheries in Indonesia. The Indonesian Government banned trawl fishing in 2015, however small trawl fisheries still operate in some areas of northern Java.","",July 1862,false,false,Global

By the 13th century, the Aurochs survived only in small numbers in Eastern Europe, where hunting it became a privilege of nobles and later royals (van Vuure 2005). In Poland the Aurochs was no longer common by the 13th century and the last herd survived in the Jaktorów forest, Masuria, where it was strictly protected by royal decree and hunting Aurochs was strictly reserved for kings under pain of death (Swiecicki 1634).

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900 m, mainly 1,200-1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger et al. 2020). Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie Freycinetia arborea, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger et al. 1998).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats, primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source, ‘ie‘ie vine Freycinetia arborea (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of Culex will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, have not been seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022).","There have been unconfirmed reports of Ou up to 1996, but no confirmed records since 1989. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.984, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.941. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. Historically Ou were widespread across much of the Hawaiian Archipelago, but were extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). The last confirmed record on Hawai'i was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998) while the last confirmed record on Kauai was 1989 (Pyle 1986).","","Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J. Lepson in litt. 1999).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes however there are records of the green feathers of Ou being utilised occasionally (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","While the most recent records were all in rainforest and only a few in weedy forest (Higgins et al. 2006), they were historically recorded nesting in orchards (Hull 1910) and red guava Pisidium cattleianum trees and feeding on fruits of olives Olea europaea (Mees 1969) and insects (Christian 2005).","Threats for this species have operated at an acuity and spatial scale that have driven it extinct. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability it is extant based on threats is 0.02 (Clarke et al. 2021). The principal threat was predation by black rats Rattus rattus which are thought to have been introduced in the mid-1940s (Robinson 1988). Most other Zosterops species persist alongside rats, including two other species on Norfolk Island, but rats appear to have exterminated the Robust White-eye Z. strenuus within ten years of colonising Lord Howe Island (Hindwood 1940, Sharland 1929). The effects of predation have been exacerbated by the clearance of much native forest and invasion of the remainder by exotic weeds. Although being baited on the ground in the National Park since the early 1990s, rats have remained common in trees and shrubs and their arboreal behaviour renders such control programs less effective (Nance et al. 2023b). Loss of good habitat to agriculture, predation by cats Felis catus and competition from the self-introduced Silvereye Zosterops lateralis, first recorded on the island in 1904, may have contributed to the white-eye’s decline but are unlikely to be primary causes (Clarke et al. 2021).","While common and widespread in 1908 (Hull 1910) and 1926 (Mees 1969), it was very scarce in 1962, with a population estimated at &lt;50 birds, and only two birds were seen in 1968 (Mees 1969). Four records during an island-wide survey in 1979 were the last multi-observer records (Schodde et al. 1983). Formal searches in the 1980s and in 2009 (Dutson 2013) failed to find the species, but poorly documented reports (detailed in Dutson 2013) suggested persistence. There have been no records since 2009 and from 2017 to 2019 postgraduate students spending three months a year working in prime white-eye habitat on the island and have seen none (R. Clarke unpublished, in Clarke et al. 2021).

There have been no records since, despite extensive searches. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that the species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.92, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.97. Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","This species inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987), where it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible. The Koa'e Valley in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (where it was potentially seen in 1995 [Conant et al. 1998]) is at 1,000-1,300 m (Pratt 1994), although it was previously seen as low as 600m (Perkins 1903).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats.

Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Kaua'i has no forest above 1,500 m and therefore offers no refugia from these fatal diseases. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009).","Many consider the last confirmed record of H. hanapepe to have been two specimens taken in 1899 (Pratt and Pyle 2000, Pyle and Pyle 2017, USFWS 2022). Despite there being at least 30 subsequent sightings since 1960, the most recent of which was in 2007 (Pratt 2010), it has been argued that none are accompanied by sufficient evidence to eliminate possible confusion with Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri (Pratt and Pyle 2000). Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.93, and the probability it is extant based on threats is 0.97. It is accordingly considered Extinct with a population size of 0. The species is likely to have always been rare: early collectors noted that it was rare or uncommon (Pyle and Pyle 2017) and there was a large gap in records between 1899 and its apparent 'rediscovery' (although see above) in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964). In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. hanapepe from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction, which they believe occurred in the early 20th century.","","Hemignathus hanapepe was endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., where the last confirmed record was two specimens taken in 1899 (Munro 1960). It probably became confined to the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998) and since its 'rediscovery' in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964) it has been reported there at least 30 times. Although at least some, if not all, of these sightings lack sufficient evidence to eliminate Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri (Pratt and Pyle 2000).","Historically, Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers there is no direct evidence to suggest that Kauai Nukupuu were used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

There have been no records since, despite extensive searches. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that the species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.93, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","It is suspected to have inhabited similar habitat to L. coccineus: wet and mesic forest, primarily of koa-'ohi'a at 1,100-2,100 m (mostly above 1,500 m) (Scott et al. 1986, Lepson and Freed 2020). Foraging habits also presumed to have been similar to L. coccineus. It fed mostly on caterpillars and spiders and used its laterally asymmetric bill to prize open leaf and flower buds in a manner akin to crossbills (Loxia spp.) (Lepson and Freed 2020).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Maui Akepa and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for food and nest-sites (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Lapointe and Atkinson 2009).","Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.93, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. The last confirmed record of Loxops ochraceus was of two birds seen in 1988 (Engilis 1990) with later unconfirmed records of birds sound recorded in 1994 and 1995 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Visual confirmation of records is required due to potential confusion with, or mimicry by, Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). L. ochraceus were described as locally abundant in 1894 (Perkins 1903) and a flock of more than 100 in 1961 led Bole (1961) to conclude they were not rare on Maui.In addition to the extinction probability analysis used here, the USFWS (2023) has now delisted L. ochraceus from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","","Loxops ochraceus was endemic to Maui, Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. Most specimens were obtained above Olinda, although some were taken from Kipahulu Valley (Pyle and Pyle 2017). Between 1950 and 1995, Loxops ochraceus were observed on the upper slopes of Haleakala, Kipahulu Valley and Ko'olau Forest Reserve. The last confirmed record in 1988 was in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve; an unconfirmed audio recording in 1994 was taken during a Rare Bird Search survey, also from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve.

Despite extensive searching in the 1970s, no Toolache Wallabies were located and there have been no confirmed reports since (Smith and Robinson 2008). There is an unvouchered report from 1943 (Flannery and Schouten 2001) and unvouchered reports from the 1950s to the 1970s (Robinson and Young 1983). Four types of probabilistic models to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of this species have been published (Fisher &amp; Humphries 2024): a 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow, 1993), a Weibull model (Roberts and Solow, 2003), a Nonparametric model (Solow and Smith, 2005), and Threat &amp; effort Cox Regression Survival model (Fisher and Blomberg, 2012). All concluded that this species is extinct with &gt;90% probability. The estimated extinction date based on confirmed sightings was 1932 (Fisher &amp; Blomberg 2012).","The Toolache Wallaby occupied open country. Its preferred habitat was grassland at the edge of woodlands of Brown Stringybark Eucalyptus baxteri with heathy understorey. Such areas were flat or gently undulating, becoming swampy in winter with depressions filled by a matted growth of Black Rush (Chaffy Saw-sedge) Gahnia filum or among tussocks of tall coarse Cutting Grass Gahnia trifida and Kangaroo Grass Themeda sp. Small areas of slightly higher ground carried sparse stands of Drooping She-oak Allocasuarina verticillata, which were used for shelter. Toolache Wallabies had an unusual gait in which the length of bounds was irregular, but were capable of high speed for long periods (Robinson and Young 1983).",Habitat loss and fragmentation was catastrophic as the whole original range is now agricultural land (Robinson and Young 1983). The introduced Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and hunting contributed to the extinction (Robinson and Young 1983).,"The Toolache Wallaby is extinct. It was common within a restricted range. By 1910, populations had been reduced to several scattered colonies in the area enclosed by Robe, Kingston and Beachport on the South Australian coast, and Naracoorte and Penola further to the east, near Mt Gambier. By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed, and led to the death of some of the few remaining individuals. The last known survivor died in captivity in Robe in 1939 (Flannery and Kendall 1990). However, some unconfirmed sightings were reported in 1953 around Lake Hawdon North (South Australia) (Stewart et al. 2001), and the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service documented reliable reports by local naturalists of small, remnant subpopulations that persisted from the 1950s until the early 1970s (Robinson and Young 2023).","","The Toolache Wallaby occurred in near-coastal parts of extreme south-western Victoria (Menkhorst 1995), to the upper south-east of South Australia (Robinson and Young 1983, Smith and Robinson 2008).

258672491,21866,Thylacinus cynocephalus,Extinct,,2025,2024-11-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last recorded killing of a wild Thylacine was in 1930, and the last known Thylacine was captured in 1933 and died in Hobart Zoo in 1936. Despite numerous reports of sightings since then including on mainland Australia (Heberle 2004), and many organised searches in Tasmania by government agencies, conservation NGOs, philanthropists, and others (more search effort than any other extinct mammal (Fisher and Blomberg 2011)), there has been no convincing evidence of its persistence. Brook et al. (2023) used uncertainty modelling of purported sightings to map a regional extirpation pattern, and concluded that it probably persisted until the 1980s, however Mooney (2023) concluded that no sightings since 1936 can be substantiated. All data sets analysed with a conservative probabilistic sighting-record resampling by Brook et al. (2023) concluded that the Thylacine has 100% probability of being extinct in 2023. The statistical approaches of Brook et al. (2023), Carlson et al. (2018) and Fisher &amp; Blomberg (2011, 2012) are robust probabilistic extinction models using sighting data that included uncertainty of records, distribution variables, search effort, and other trait data. There have been at least six classes of quantitative models applied to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of the thylacine in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Fisher and Humphries 2024). 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow 1993), 2) Weibull model / Optimal linear estimation (Roberts and Solow 2003), 3) Nonparametric (Solow and Smith 2005), 4) Cox Regression Survival model of threat and effort (Fisher and Blomberg 2012), 5) Bayesian Stationary Poisson model with varying certainty of sightings and independent processes for valid and invalid sightings (Solow and Beet 2014, Carlson et al. 2018), 6) Stationary Poisson with resampling (Brook et al. 2019, Brook et al. 2023). These have used a range of assumptions about the data distribution and certainty, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and sets of different sources of data including sighting dates, species traits, measures of effort, distributional data, and observer reliability. Virtually all have concluded that the Thylacine is extinct, and nearly all (and all with physical evidence) have concluded that the extinction date was in the 1930s or 1940s. Additionally, from 2014 to 2020, 3,225 camera trap sites throughout Tasmania leading to photographs on &gt;315,000 camera nights revealed no detections of anything that could be attributed to a Thylacine (C.N. Johnson pers. comm.).","Thylacines occurred in most habitats in Tasmania, but apparently not the dense temperate rainforests of the south-west (Paddle 2000). The skull of the Thylacine is highly convergent with the wolf suggesting similar dietary ecology (Newton 2021), although it probably had a less powerful bite than a wolf (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). It was likely an endurance runner ('coursing predator') that hunted and scavenged mainly at night, singly or in pairs. Before it was widely persecuted, diurnal observations were also reported (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its main food items were reported to be kangaroos and wallabies. Dens were often located among rocks and in caves, Paddle (1993) describes a 1903 photograph of a den in a shallow cave containing nesting material of ferns. Litters (of up to four young, usually two or three) were also discovered amongst dense vegetation.","There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of a perceived threat to sheep, and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). From 1830 (less than three decades after Europeans arrived in Tasmania), companies and individual landowners began offering bounty payments (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its eradication was funded by a Tasmanian government scheme from 1888 to 1909, and a bounty was paid for more than 2,200 Thylacines killed (Heberle et al. 2004, Sleightholme and Campbell 2016). This is a similar number to the estimated Thylacine population of Tasmania at any one time (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Collecting by museums and zoos was also a major reason for hunting in the early 20th century. A disease similar to canine distemper could have contributed to extinction (Paddle 2012). However single-species population viability analysis models are unable to account for extinction unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate is assumed, even if disease effects are included from 1906 to 1909. Thylacine extinction in Tasmania is readily recreated using disease-free multi-species models that simulate declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse et al. 2013).",This species is presumed to be extinct.,"","The Thylacine was once found on the island of New Guinea and was widespread on the Australian mainland, but disappeared from everywhere except Tasmania by at least 2000 years ago, probably because of predation by and competition from the Dingo Canis lupus (Johnson 2006). In modern times it was known only in Tasmania, which was isolated from the Australian mainland c. 8,000 – 10,000 years ago, before the arrival of the Dingo on the mainland. It was widespread in Tasmania, but most abundant in open forest and woodland (Guiler 1985, Paddle 2000). It occurred in most habitat types from low (east) to high (north-west) rainfall but at low densities in the south-west where rainfall is very high, soil fertility is very low, and vegetation is hummock grassland (button grass), wet scrub, or wet forest.","",Terrestrial,"In 1936, the Thylacine received legal protection under Tasmanian law (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023).

The species was last sighted in 1759, so it appears to have undergone a rapid decline, likely due to severe deforestation starting from the 1730s (Hume 2017).",None remain.,"","Lophopsittacus bensoni was described from a lower mandible, palatine and tarsometatarsus found in caves near Port Louis, Mauritius (Holyoak 1973).

It was last reported in 1761 and presumably went extinct soon after from a combination of deforestation, over-hunting, and introduced predators.","Nothing is known, though it is likely to have been a forest species. Early observations suggest the species mainly occupied the small islet to the south of Rodrigues, where they fed on small black seeds, visiting the mainland primarily to drink (Hume 2017).","The exact cause of extinction is uncertain, but deforestation, over-hunting, egg predation from rats, and predation by cats, are all thought to have contributed to its extinction (Hume 2017).",None remain.,"","Necropsittacus rodricanus is known from Rodrigues, Mauritius, from several early travellers' reports (Cheke 1987) and a number of subfossil bones (Cowles 1987).",Over-hunting is presumed to be a contributor to the species' extinction (Hume 2017).,Terrestrial,"",Afrotropical,1761,false,false,Global

Over-hunting and severe deforestation appear to be the primary drivers of its extinction.","Historical reports suggest the species had high forest dependence, however it was hunted due to the damage it did to crops, so clearly occasionally ventured into more open areas, and apparently fed in coffee plantations (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014, Hume 2017). The species' morphology suggests it was an opportunistic forager that occupied all forest strata (Hume 2014). The species was likely omnivorous, as are most starlings, and nested in tree cavities (Hume 2017). Historical observations also suggest the species was a vertical migrant, breeding in mountain forests during summer (Hume 2014).","The primary causes of the species' extinction were undoubtedly deforestation and hunting. Historical reports suggest that the species primarily occupied the interior of forests (Hume 2017). As deforestation accelerated through the 1830s (Hume 2017), this would have caused the rapid decline of the species' habitat. The species did however move into coffee plantations where it would feed on insects that plagued the coffee flowers (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014), but as plantations gave way to sugarcane during the 1830s, even this marginal habitat was lost (Hume 2017). As the species was also considered a pest, it was heavily hunted during the 1800s (Hume 2017). Supposedly, the species was easily approached, and hunters could take dozens at a time as a consequence (Cheke 1987, Hume 2017). There are also suggestions that disease contacted from introduced Acroditheres tristris (Common Mynas) and impacts from introduced cats and rats may also have caused declines, but as mynas occurred on the island as early as 1759 (Cheke and Hume 2008), and the species survived for decades alongside cats and rats, any declines from these threats are likely negligible (Hume 2017).",No extant population remains.,"",Fregilupus varius was endemic to Réunion (to France).,The species was heavily persecuted for the damage it did to crops (Hume 2017).,Terrestrial,"",Afrotropical,1859,false,false,Global
