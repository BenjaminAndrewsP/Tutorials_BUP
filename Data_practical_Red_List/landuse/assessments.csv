1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,Extinct in the Wild,,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that Allotoca goslinei was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus et al. (2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (Salix spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. Allotoca goslinei was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a Nasturtium-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, Moxostoma mascotae (now: Moxostoma austrinum), a Goodeid, Allodontichthys n. sp. (now: Allodontichthys polylepis) and a Poeciliid, Poeciliopsis infans. Rana sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned Ilyodon furcidens being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez et al. 2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb et al. 2004). Schindler reported to Hieronimus (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","Allotoca goslinei was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) occurred, which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while Allotoca goslinei decreased in abundance. The Swordtail is thought to have displaced Allotoca goslinei through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus et al. 2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989).","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus et al. in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus et al. 2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000 Alloctoca goslinei was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found. Based on this, the Banded Allotoca is feared to be Extinct in the Wild (Lyons 2011). A few captive strains do exist in Europe, Mexico and the United States, but all of them are low in numbers and not easy to maintain.","","The Banded Allotoca was endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco and historically only known from few collections in the headwaters of the Río Ameca, namely from the type location, the Río Grande (or Río, Arroyo, Potrero Grande about 10 km west of the town of Ameca), and from the Río Cuisillos (1 km east of the train station at Pacana near the Presa La Vega, where it coalesces with the Río Salado forming up the Río Ameca) (Smith and Miller 1987). From this distribution pattern, it can be inferred that it was more widespread in the headwaters of the Río Ameca drainage, but stayed either unnoticed or was very scarce. However, it was eliminated from the Río Ameca by the late 1990's, but remained moderately common in the Río Potrero Grande (Lyons 2011), until non-native swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) invaded the river after 2000. Being the dominant species in 2000, with about 75% proportional abundance, the numbers of Allotoca goslinei declined rapidly thereafter, and extensive samplings in 2005 and 2006 didn't show a single individual (Helmus et al. 2009).

Since the 1980s there have been several comprehensive surveys for it by island based botanists and naturalists (notably Mr G. McCormack), the current Cook Islands Flora writer (Mr W.R. Sykes of Landcare Research, New Zealand) and other botanists visiting the island (for example Dr(s) W.A. Whistler, P.J. de Lange, R.O. Gardner, T.J. Martin and Mr E.K. Cameron) over the last forty years. Given the survey effort, the lack of relatively intact potential habitat, and the island’s small size (67 km2) there now seems little doubt that A. wilderi has gone extinct.","Very little is known about this species ecology; the few collections and notes available suggest it was a small shrub, rarely exceeding 2 m in height according to Wilder (1931), and a species of “open” forested habitats within an altitudinal range of 200-300 m asl (Wilder 1931, W.R. Sykes pers. comm. 2011).","Acalypha wilderi was most probably a naturally uncommon species (see comments by Cheeseman 1903, Wilder 1931). It is only known from a handful of specimens collected between 1899 and 1929. These were all collected from forested habitats though there is conflict as to the exact type of habitat. Cheeseman (1903, p. 205) states “shaded woods near Arorangi” and Wilder (1931, p. 64) states “in semi-dry valleys, back of village of Avarua, altitude 200 to 300 m”). These are the only botanists to have provided any details as to the species likely habitat preferences. However, W.R. Sykes (pers. comm. 2011) is strongly of the opinion that this was a species of open forested habitats. Irrespective, the lowland and slope forests of Rarotonga, and especially those in the vicinity of Avarua and Arorangi are amongst the most heavily modified on the island as a result of deforestation for agriculture, roading, housing and plantation forestry. What few forested areas now remain are also seriously damaged and heavily infested with a range of weeds (ranging from small shrubs to trees and vines). Faced with these threats, it is hardly surprising that a small, apparently already uncommon shrub like A. wilderi has vanished. As comprehensive surveys of the vegetation of Rarotonga over the last forty years have failed to rediscover this species it now seems very likely that it is extinct (see also comments by Whistler 1988). Nevertheless, as with any “extinct” plant there always remains a slim chance that it may yet be rediscovered somewhere else on Rarotonga though over time and with increasing survey effort this seems rather unlikely.",This species is extinct.,"","As far as is known A. wilderi was only ever known from forested habitats on the northern (Avarua) and western (Arorangi) sides of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands (Cheeseman 1903, Wilder 1931) within an altitudinal range of 200-300 m asl.",This species is extinct.,Terrestrial,This species is thought to be extinct.,Oceanian,1929,false,false,Global

In the east angle arises the main spring under the roots of a large Metasequoia tree. ","The species has disappeared from the wild. The biggest threat to a wild population will be non-native fish species. Several exotic species have been introduced near the type locality resulting in declines in native fishes within the Río Teuchitlán (Miller 2005). Meanwhile, exotic species (Oreochromis sp., Xiphophorus hellerii, Poecilia mexicana, Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus) make up to 95% of the individuals in the spring area of Teuchitlán (Medina-Nava et al. 2017). A study revealed that densities of Goodeid species were lower or were absent in localities in the Río Teuchitlán, where introduced species were abundant or where there were more than one introduced species (De La Vega-Salazar et al. 2003b). The river has been degraded due to the construction of the La Vega Dam and it is suggested that habitat degradation may have been the cause of the extant endemic Goodeids now being confined to a small area at the headwaters of the river. The species was also threatened as consequence of the springs being turned into spas, preventing movement of fish between pools (De La Vega-Salazar et al. 2003a).","This species is believed to be Extinct in the Wild and disappeared from the Río Teuchitlán due to competition from non-native fish, eventually Xiphophorus maculatus, through water pollution and river fragmentation, and modification of the springs into a water recreation area. The subpopulation from the El Molino pond, discovered in 2006, was a victim of a heavy drought in 2010 and became extirpated as well. ","","The Golden Skiffia is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco. It was historically only known from the Río Teuchitlán in the Río Ameca headwaters and from the Río Ameca itself about 12 km east of the town of Ameca. Individuals collected from the El Molino pond (in 2006) in the endorheic Laguna de Sayula basin also belong to this species and those from the Presa La Ciénaga (Presa Buenavista), upper Río Ameca drainage, should be Golden Skiffia as well due to the drainage (determined as Skiffia multipunctata in 1963, before Skiffia francesae was described). Specimens from a historical collection (1939) of the Splotched Skiffia by Miller in a river near Santa Cruz de las Flores, endorheic Laguna Atotonilco drainage, probably belonged to Skiffia francesae as well due to the hydrographic history of this basin (Zacoalco paleolake included parts of the upper Río Ameca drainage), but this is uncertain. However, this species disappeared from all of these habitats and only persists in captivity.","The species is not used for human consumption, but targeted in the aquarium trade by a certain degree. In the 1970's a hybrid with Skiffia multipunctata (called ""Black Beauty"") was bred and regionally distributed, but probably disappeared again from the hobby.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"No reintroduction or conservation actions are currently known for this species, but the Río Teuchitlán and the La Vega Dam are both sites included within a Ramsar site (Ramsar Secretariat Site No.2026, 2009). Although this does not include the Ameca River directly, it is the next extent of the water flow from these two systems, and so any conservation actions or water quality controls within these water-bodies might continue down stream into the Ameca River.In 2016, the Michoacan University started a reintroduction project for Zoogoneticus tequila and Notropis amecae, both emdemic to the Río Ameca headwaters. The first one, a Goodeid, and the second, a Cyprinid species, inhabited the Río Teuchitlán drainage in historical time, but have been extirpated by unknown reasons. The reintroduction area is focusing on the spring area and the subsequent river sections, mainly the part that is used as a trough, and the schedule includes a complete extraction of non-native fish species from these sections and a long term species control. This action would have a direct positive impact on the Golden Skiffia as exotics represent about 90% of the individuals, so a reintroduction of the species could be successful.",Neotropical,2010,false,false,Global

Population declines were first noted in the 1970s when lake levels were lowered. In 1988 a massive outflow event resulted in a catastrophic drop in lake level of 60 cm, isolating the zone were the species is normally found. This combined with interference of inflow streams, and hot, dry summers have led to extensive damage to the entire lake's littoral zone. Repeated visits to the area between 1992 and 2000 failed to locate the species leading to the conclusion that the species should be considered extinct. However some shells of this species were collected in 2009 (Fischer et al. 2009), so there are two possible conclusions a) these are subfossil shells washed out from sediment b) that it is possible that the species may have survived in a small groundwater source and that species is extant.

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,Extinct,,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The red alga Vanvoorstia bennettiana has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world). The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855. This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels. The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships. This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988. Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until 23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site. No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus Sargassum, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions. The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886. This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since. The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic. The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata and the green alga Caulerpa filiformis growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions. No specimens of Vanvoorstia bennettiana have been discovered. Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline. Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus Vanvoorstia, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which Vanvoorstia bennettiana belongs, such areas should harbor this species. In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [Vanvoorstia bennettiana] either cast up or by dredging."" He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936. The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position. She was also unable to rediscover this species. Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast. Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between. The red algal species Vanvoorstia bennettiana has not been discovered during any of these dives. Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations. This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce. There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable. In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters. The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886. The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores. Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

Paxton in litt.].","","","First collected/discovered (1855) by crude dredging as a single individual plant from the east end of Spectacle Island, in the Parramatta River, Port Jackson, Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

The 2014 assessment is observing the five year rule set out in section 2.2.1 of the Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which requires a species to remain in its original category for a time period of five years from the time it no longer meets the criteria for that category (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). As reintroductions began in 2013, the species will require reassessment in 2018. This five-year time period will allow for monitoring of the species' recovery and the viability of its re-introduced population.","This species lived only in soaked herbaceous vegetation in the spray zone of the Kihansi Falls. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system is currently in place to mimic the original conditions of the spray zone. The toad breeds by internal fertilization, with females retaining the larvae internally in the oviduct until little toadlets are born. Clutch size varies from 5–13 offspring (Channing et al. 2006).","The serious decline and extinction of this species appears tp be related to the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project, which involved the construction of a dam upstream on the Kihansi River in 2000. The dam cut off 90% of the original water flow to the gorge, thereby hugely reducing the volume of spray, particularly in the dry season, as well as altering the vegetational composition. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system was set up to mimic the natural spray of the Kihansi ecosystem with the remaining water flow. Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006). The impact of predation by safari ants (Dorylus sp.) and crabs (Potomonautes sp.) is unknown (Channing et al. 2006).","Formerly it was abundant in a tiny area, with a population of around 17,000 individuals. Reports indicate that the species fluctuated naturally in its population size. The population appeared to be at a high in May 1999, dropping to lower numbers in the course of 2001 and 2002 [total population estimates oscillated at around 11,000 individuals up until March 2002; see Channing et al. 2006], and at a high again in June 2003 [a total population estimate of 20,989 individuals; Channing et al. 2006]. However, subsequently the population went into steep decline, and by mid-January 2004, only three individuals could be seen and just two males were heard calling. There were a few records of calling animals during the rest of 2004, and an unconfirmed report from May 2005 (CBSG 2007), but there were no records of any individuals in subsequent years, despite surveys, leading to the species being listed as Extinct in the Wild in May 2009.In an effort to re-introduce the species into the wild, Toledo and Bronx Zoos have been conducting an ex situ breeding programme. In June 2012 1,000 toads were involved in release experiments (where some were retained in a captive facility at Kihansi and a few were sent to the gorge). In October 2012 2,000 toads were re-introduced back to the gorge. In October 2013 2,000 toads were involved in several activities (where some were kept at Kihansi captive breeding facility, some were used for release experiments and some were re-introduced back to the gorge). There is a plan to re-introduce another 2,000 toads to the wild probably in October 2014 (W. Ngalason  pers. comm. July 2014).","","This species was a micro-endemic of the Kihansi Falls, in the Kihansi Gorge, in the Udzungwa Mountains, eastern Tanzania, at 600-940 m asl. Its global range covered an area of less than two hectares around the Kihansi Falls, and searches for it around other waterfalls on the escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains have not located any additional populations (Channing et al. 2006).","In 2000, at the invitation of the Tanzanian government, the Bronx Zoo collected 499 individuals to establish an ex-situ breeding programme in view of creating an assurance population.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This toad is not known from any protected areas.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters.

The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be established some time in the near future. When that happens, its Red List status will need to be reassessed.","Studies have been carried out on the behaviour, ecology and reproduction of Père David’s Deer in Beijing since 1985, in Dafeng since 1986, and in Shishou since 2001. This species lives in low-lying grasslands and reed beds, often in seasonally flooded areas such as the lower Yangtze River valley and coastal marshes. It eats grass, reeds and leaves of bushes, can swim well, and spend long periods in water. It lives in single sex ormaternal herds. Animals reach maturity during second year. Gestation is 270-300 days. One, rarely two young are born. These are weaned in 10-11 months. Adults live up to 18 years. Data from the Dafeng Reserve suggests that female E. davidianus establish a home range of approximately 1 km² (Hu and Jiang 2002).","The species became extinct in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting. The size of the reintroduced population was only 120 in 1993 (Cao 1993), although has increased to over 2,000 since that time (Yang et al. 2008). Low genetic diversity has been identified as a long-term threat by Zeng et al. (2007) and Yang et al. (2008). It is unclear how much native habitat remains on which E. davidianus can exist in a free-ranging state.","After decades of ex situ conservation, the species breeds successfully in captivity (Beck and Wemmer 1983). In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang et al. 2000a).The second re-introduction of E. davidianus was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang et al. 2000b). The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang et al. 2000b). E. davidianus from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang et al. 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 E. davidianus in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. In November, 2002, 30 E. davidianus (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li et al. 2007). Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of E. davidianus in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang et al. 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed E. davidianus herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.","","This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. Fossils of Elaphurus bifurcatus, E. chinanensis chia, E. lantianensis have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of Elaphurus, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, P. davidianus was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of P. davidianus shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). P. davidianus is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of P. davidianus in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” P. davidianus in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52). Nevertheless, the heavily inbred Père David’s Deer safely passed though the genetic bottleneck of inbreeding and adopted the vast open parkland of an English country estate (Jones et al. 1983).The captive population started to increase (though with a setback during the First World War due to food shortage), and since the Second World War, the animals started to be spread through captive facilities worldwide, with the first captive animals being sent back to Beijing Zoo in 1956.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is listed on the Chinese Red List as Extinct in the Wild, and on the China Key List - I. Recommended conservation action includes:1. Establish additional populations when and where appropriate, with the aim of re-establishing a genuinely wild, free-ranging population. 2. Conduct surveys of the four free-living sub-populations in Hubei and Hunan provinces to assess their long-term viability.3. Establish a genetic management programme of all populations in China. 4. Develop conservation education programmes to raise conservation awareness among the local people and general public.Following a trial release of this species in the Dafeng Reserve, China, Hu and Jiang (2002) concluded that future releases will necessitate either natural or artificial boundaries to alleviate conflict between introduced E. davidianus and farmers, on whose land the deer are likely to stray. These authors suggest a reintroduction model based on that of Oryx leucoryx in Oman (Stanley Price 1989).",Palearctic,1939,false,false,Global

The species was first recorded in 1719 by Kolbe, and was described by Pallas in 1766 (Klein 1974) from material of uncertain provenance (Rookmaaker 1989). Its historical distribution is thus based on few records, of which only two can be considered to be reasonably precise (Kerley et al. 2009): Thunberg on 20 January 1774 and Le Vaillant in March/April 1783. An additional record in 1783 provided by Sparrman (1786) much further east at Krakeel River in the Langkloof may reflect a transported skin, given that this location is hundreds of kilometres east of other records. However, although the recent historical range is thought to be bounded by the locations of the Caledon, Swellendam and Bredasdorp, in the Western Cape (Skead 1980, Rookmaaker 1989), archaeological evidence suggests a previously much wider distribution: early in the Last Glacial (70,000–35,000 years before present (ybp)) it occurred on the grasslands of the Cape lowlands, south of the Cape Folded Belt from present day Grahamstown (farm ‘‘Uniondale’’) in the east to the vicinity of Saldanha Bay in the West. A similar distribution has been inferred for the early (ca 10,000 ybp) Holocene (Klein 1974, Cruz-Uribe et al. 2003). During the late Pleistocene (18,000–10,000 ybp), analysis of rock paintings reveal that the species occurred as far north as the eastern parts of South Africa’s Free State Province (Loubser et al. 1990, Plug and Engela 1992, Plug and Badenhorst 2001).","",Terrestrial,This species is now Extinct.,Afrotropical,1799-1800,false,false,Global

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the Craugastor rugulosus series (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the Craugastor rugulosus group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides. The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden et al. 2013, Wicaksono et al. 2017, Lyra et al. 2017, Neate-Clegg et al. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds et al. 2006, Blaustein et al. 2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J.

61462199,231,Acipenser dabryanus,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2019-09-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is endemic to China, where its natural range is restricted to the Yangtze River drainage and major tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, and Jialing rivers. In the late 20th century, the population declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. The population now appears to be Extinct in the Wild, as there is no evidence for natural reproduction any more, and no mature fish have been caught within the last 10 years.","Yangtze Sturgeon permanently lives in freshwater. It usually inhabits the upper and middle reaches of the river (it may also have entered the upper estuary of the Yangtze River). This species spawns in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–December). Its key spawning reach was between Maoshui and Hejiang, a stretch of 321.7 km (Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).","Historically, this species experienced unsustainable levels of fishing. Furthermore, mesh sizes of fishing nets have been reduced, thereby capturing young sturgeon, especially during the periods when many juveniles concentrate to feed. Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night. The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May. This is also the spawning season for Acipenser dabryanus, therefore spawning stocks were particularly vulnerable to capture. The construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981 and the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 have also caused major adverse effects to the habitat of this species and, prior to the wild population disappearing, these constructions caused the population to be restricted to the upstream river, above the dams. The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river. Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin. Much untreated waste water discharges into the river each year. Water quality is also affected by run-off caused by deforestation of the upper Yangtze Valley (Zhuang et al. 1997). Pollution has been declining regionally in recent years.","There seems to be no natural reproduction of this species any more, and there are no mature individuals of wild origin due to heavy overfishing. Historically, this was an important species in commercial fisheries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007). In the late 20th century, population numbers declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catch data between 1982 and 2019 indicate that since 2008, hundreds of individuals are being captured annually, all originating from releases (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). The species is now fully ranched, and no natural reproduction or natural population is documented in the wild. Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful. Since 2018, mature individuals have also been stocked. This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.","","This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system. Historically, under the natural, unaltered conditions that existed until the middle of the 20th century, this species inhabited the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its large tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, Jialing, Xiang and Han rivers, as well as the large lakes attached to the Yangtze River. Acipenser dabryanus had been extirpated from the lower river, possibly since 1995, and it was restricted to the upper main stream of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Province (Zhuang et al. 1997). Starting in 2007, the conservation release programme was carried out in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, this fish can be found in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the confluences with some tributaries. However, the majority of individuals observed in the river originate from large scale releases and reproduction of the species in the wild has not been confirmed for at least two decades (one generation length for this species is 30 years).","Acipenser dabryanus was caught intensively for human consumption until the year 2000. Since 2000, sturgeons are only taken accidentally as bycatch and were mostly released, however post-release survival was low. Since 2021, a full ban of fishing (for all fish species) in the Yangtze River main stem is in place to protect the endemic fish fauna. There is a large production of this species in aquaculture for restocking and conservation purposes.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing will be banned completely by 2021 in the main stem of the Yangtze River. In 2000, the first national nature reserve was created in the upper Yangzte River. The area of this reserve was extended in 2005 to mitigate the conflict between hydroelectric projects and maintenance of ecosystem functionality. The reserve is now the largest aquatic reserve in China, which has a total length of 1,162.6 km, including 436.5 km of the main river (Zhang et al. 2009). Acipenser dabryanus has been listed as a First Class Protected Animal of the State since 1988, and has received the same effective protection as the Chinese Sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis). This species was also listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998. There is also a national action plan for the species. It is considered that the survival of Yangtze Sturgeon entirely relies on stocking efforts, without which this species would possibly become extinct (Zhang et al. 2009). Artificial propagation was first carried out in 1976. The second and third generation propagation were carried out successfully by the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute in 2013 and 2018, respectively. From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation. In 2018, around 40 mature individuals were released into the same waters.

Some cultivated specimens have been replanted in semi-wild situations since the 1980s, but little or no recruitment has been observed except at one site.The species was listed as ‘Critically Endangered C2a(i); D’ by Cairns-Wicks (2003). The transfer of status to ‘Extinct in the Wild’ is the result of the death of the last surviving individuals in the wild.","She Cabbage is a small tree, though it may reach 9 m in height under favourable conditions. Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months. There is considerable variation in seed viability between individuals which suggests a degree of self-incompatibility, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. The achenes possess a pappus and are dispersed by the wind, but at some sites the majority are consumed by introduced bird species.The unusually soft wood is prone to rapid decay and is host to several species of endemic wood-boring invertebrates. This xylophagous fauna is still poorly-known and its degree of overlap with other hosts is unclear. At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: Opogona sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.","Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18th Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.","From the 20th Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known. In the 1950s Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.","","The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island. This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19th Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant.

The Central Ridge, which extends for less than 10 kilometres, has now been extensively explored and there is little chance of further individuals remaining undetected.","Stringwood was a monoecious shrub, evidently wind-pollinated, with long male catkins. The solitary female flowers matured into red capsules containing 3 seeds which were moderately large for an Acalypha species and had no obvious means of dispersal, unless by some long-extinct bird species.

67371983,30560,Trochetiopsis erythroxylon,Extinct in the Wild,,2016,2015-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last wild St Helena Redwood tree (Trochetiopsis erythroxylon) died in the 1950s. Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (Mus musculus) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (Sus domesticus), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18th Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (Commidendrum robustum (Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived  of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (Mus musculus) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.","Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19th Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.","","The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.","",Terrestrial,"Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between T. erythroxylon and the related Dwarf Ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to T. erythroxylon parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.",Afrotropical,1950s,false,false,Global
67372241,37598,Nesiota elliptica,Extinct,,2016,2015-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The St Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica) is almost certainly Extinct. The population was extremely small for at least 120 years before the final tree died in 1994. Well under 1 km2 of suitable habitat remains along St Helena’s Central Ridge and this has been searched extensively by botanists over recent decades.,"Based on existing evidence, it appears that this species was an inhabitant of cloud forest around St Helena’s highest altitudes (above 750 m). The 20th Century specimen at Mt Actaeon grew in Tree Fern thicket (Cronk 2002), but it is also likely to have occurred in more mixed vegetation with other upland trees on steep slopes below the ridge crest. As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (Trochetiopsis erythroxylon (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (Lachanodes arborea (Roxb.) B.Nord.).The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months. The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).","The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18th Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20th Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests. It is entirely possible that susceptibility to introduced fungal pathogens may have played a longer term role in the overall demise.","Intact fragments of St Helena Olive habitat probably persisted until the late 1800s, when Solander noted trees up to 30 foot high (approx. 9 m) (see Cronk 2002). A century later, only 12-15 trees remained, and these reputedly attained little more than half the former stature (Melliss 1875). When George Benjamin discovered a single specimen near Mt Actaeon* in 1977 the species had not been seen for many years. This proved to be the last known wild specimen in existence. It died in 1994 but seedlings and a cutting had been propagated from it, and a few cultivated individuals continued the line. Unfortunately these did not survive long, the last succumbing to fungal infections in 2003.(*There is some controversy of the naming of the three summits in the Diana’s Peak range. We here refer to Mt Actaeon as the most northerly in the series.)","","The St Helena Olive formerly occurred in the uplands of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. So few specimens survived to the historical period that the original range is difficult to reconstruct. Nearly all old records are from the Diana’s Peak area, although Roxburgh also noted it from “the Sandy Bay range” (see Beatson 1816), presumably meaning that it was more widely distributed along the Central Ridge.","The wood was undoubtedly used for timber, but the harvest is unlikely to have been regular since the mid 19th Century as specimens have become increasingly scarce.",Terrestrial,"After the rediscovery of the single tree in 1977, an intensive rescue attempt was mounted in with expert help from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Jackson 1991). They found that the species possessed a self-incompatibility breeding system resulting in less than 1% fertility. It consequently proved difficult to raise seedlings, and only one out of hundreds of cuttings was successful. Fungal infections killed the wild tree and blighted attempts to rear plants in cultivation, eventually leading to the death of the last daughter individual.",Afrotropical,2003,false,false,Global

This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being common to extinct in less than a year, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This was a mostly aquatic species largely restricted to the shallow section of fast-flowing creeks and streams in rainforest. It was only recorded from pristine rainforest where there was no disturbance. Males would call in summer along the edge of creeks and streams. It was one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceeded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero et al. 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999). Eungella National Park is subject to weed invasion on the edges of the reserve (Winter and McDonald 1986). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, chytridiomycosis (present in at least some rainforest streams at Eungella) must be suspected as the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. The Eungella Torrent Frog (Taudactylus eugellensis), which inhabited the same streams, was actively preyed upon by Rhobatrachus vitellinus (Winter and McDonald 1986) and suffered a steep population decline around the same time as R. vitellinus was discovered to have traces of infection from the chytrid fungus (McDonald 1990, Rettalick et al. 2004). Taudactylus eugellensis has been implicated as a host and reservoir for the chytrid fungus (Rettalick et al. 2004) so it is therefore very likely that transmission of the fungus occurred between these species.","The species was considered common across its range until January 1985 when the first signs of decline (reported by Winter and McDonald 1986) were observed at lower altitudes (about 400 m asl) (McDonald 1990). At higher altitudes the frogs remained common until March 1985, but were absent in June of that year (McDonald 1990). Despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded again within Eungella National Park or any other locations (Ingram and McDonald 1993, McDonald and Alford 1999, Meyer et al. 2020). Most recently, between 2000–2015 surveys targeting this species and other endemics in the region at 114 sites within Eungella National Park and adjoining State Forest found no trace of the species. This species is considered to be extinct.","","This Australian endemic species was discovered in January 1984 (Mahony et al. 1984) and was found exclusively in undisturbed rainforest in Eungella National Park, mid-eastern Queensland at altitudes of 400–1,000 m asl (Covacevich and McDonald 1993).

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer et al. 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler et al. 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower Ageratina riparia), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species Taudactylus diurnus (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards et al. (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines et al. 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.","","This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines et al. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999).

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards et al. (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards et al. 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger et al. 1999, Schloegel et al. 2006). Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards et al. 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards et al. 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards et al. 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero et al. 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero et al. 2002, Schloegel et al. 2006).

In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm Archontophoenix cunninghamia, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (Lomandra longifolia, Carex neurochlamys, Elatostema reticulatum and Blechnum nudum) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with Lantana camara (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like Rheobatrachus silus, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines et al. 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). The species was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with Lantana camara or where the weeds Baccharis halimifolia and Ageratina riparia (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy et al. 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines et al. 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990). There is no information on population size, structure, genetics or dynamics (Hines et al. 1999). This species is now believed to be extinct.","","This Australian endemic species occurred in disjunctive subpopulations in three sub-coastal mountain ranges (Blackall, Conondale, and D’Aguilar Ranges) in southeast Queensland from Coonoon Gibber Creek in the north, to Mount Glorious in the south (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Hines et al. 1999). The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species was about 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999). The species occurred over a relatively narrow altitudinal range of 350-800 m asl with most records falling between 500–800 m asl (Czechura and Ingram 1990).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceThe species was formerly known from Kondalilla, Conondale, Mapleton Falls, Obi Obi Gorge, Maiala, and Manorina National Parks (Tyler 1997).",Australasian,1979,false,false,Global
79818502,4288,Rucervus schomburgki,Extinct,,2015,2014-11-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The wild Thai population of Schomburgk’s Deer died out around 1932, with the last captive individual being killed in 1938. None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19th century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.","","Rucervus schomburgki was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008).Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath in litt. 2008).Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara et al. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures. The indication that a remnant population might still survive (Schroering 1995 and in litt. as reported in Grubb 2005, MacPhee and Flemming 1999) was followed up by investigation, independently by several people, of Phongsali province, Lao PDR, by field survey and interview. This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth et al. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive. However, any future indication of its existence should be followed up carefully. If by chance the species does survive, legislation giving it the highest levels of protection (in whatever country it was found), and an assessment of specific conservation needs would be imperative.",Indomalayan,last captive 1938; last wild animal known in 1932,false,false,Global

Some individuals remain in captive breeding facilities and a reintroduction plan is being developed.","It once inhabited dry to moist `ohi`a-koa forest and woodlands, but it later became confined to high mountain forest. It is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on the fruit of native understory plants (Maxfield 1998, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999). As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006). Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006). Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko et al. 2003).","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006). The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006). During breeding the species is sensitive to human disturbance (Faike 2006), including nest-monitoring operations (Banko et al. 2002, Walters 2006). Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose Herpestes javanicus and the native Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius (classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) and Toxoplasma gondii carried by feral cats (Banko et al. 2002, J. Burgett in litt. 2007, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Feral cats are ubiquitous in the species's habitat and are also potential predators (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko et al. 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009), and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006), could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in C. hawaiiensis, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow C. brachyrhynchos in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett in litt. 2007).","In 1992, there were only 11 or 12 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009), and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002. The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006). The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011).","","Corvus hawaiiensis was distributed historically on Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009). Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayBetween 1993 and 2007, over 90 birds were hatched in the captive breeding programme (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009). Captive-raised individuals were released into lightly-managed habitat and monitored (Kuehler et al. 1994, Lieberman 1997, Banko 2009), but releases were stopped after January 1999 due to increasing mortality (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Relocation of problematic B. solitarius failed because the birds homed back from over 32 km (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Two reintroduction sites have now been identified (Nelson in litt. 2012). Following ungulate removal, fencing and habitat restoration, reintroduction at Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve is due to begin with the release of 6 birds hatched in 2016. Ongoing restoration effort continues at the second site. A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009, outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation to minimize loss of genetic diversity, protecting suitable habitat and managing threats to the species, establishing new populations in managed habitat, establishing a program to increase public support, and continuing research and adaptive management practices for species recovery (USFWS 2009). Each year, around 2,000 school children and students attend the environmental education programme and see C. hawaiiensis in captivity at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Centre (Faike 2006).Conservation Actions ProposedRestore and manage a significant proportion of remaining habitat within the species's historical range. Deal creatively with the problem posed by B. solitarius (Maxfield 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Develop captive breeding programmes and reintroduce birds to habitat managed to reduce major threats. Exclude ungulates from more areas of habitat.

In particular, declines appear to have taken place in most native lizard species following the introduction of the Indian Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus) in the early 1980s (Andrew et al. 2016), and Wolf Snake predation is now understood to be the proximate cause of this skink's extinction.

These introductions had deleterious consequences for resident earthworms, as was noted by Smith (1894) and Lee (1961). After the only collection of this species, rapid urbanisation has meant that what was once an outer suburb 10 km from Auckland city centre is now fully encompassed. The hill at Mt Wellington is surrounded on three sides by houses, industries or retail stores and, on one quadrant, by what was the country’s largest quarry for aggregate (a mixture of crushed rock) that from 2008 was developed as a housing area now called Stonefields.  In 1963, a 45,100 m³ reservoir was constructed near the summit of the cone.  One lower slope apron has the Winifred Huggins Woodland Park that was opened in February, 1979 as an ""English woodland"" planted from 1969 by Miss Huggins and others. Trees include European beech, olives, pines and macrocarpa - a large one of which occupies the crater. Macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa also known as Monterey cypress) was first brought to New Zealand in the 1860s. Native earthworms are unlikely to survive such unremitting encroachments unless there are nature corridor reserves or remnant bushland refuges. A survey of Mt Wellington in 2011 (Blakemore 2012) found only exotics which have out-lasted and out-competed natives as there was no evidence of T. orthostichon, nor of any other truly New Zealand earthworms.

Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green et al. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to Bd, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% Bd positive rates in tested toads (Polasik et al. 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik et al. 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002, 2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik et al. 2015). As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).","","This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km2 of the Laramie Basin. It was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). In 1987, a small remnant population was discovered at Mortenson Lake (Stone 1991). In 1989, all remaining wild individuals from Mortenson Lake were taken into captivity, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015). It is known from an elevation of 2,164 m asl (Green et al. 2014).",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceThis species occurs within the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which encompasses four impoundments: Mortenson, Garber, Gibbs, and Soda lakes. The refuge is closed to the public (USFWS 2002e). Current management focuses on captive breeding and the release of larvae and toadlets at Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge (USFWS 2002). Efforts are being made to establish additional suitable release sites on public lands and private lands protected through Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2002). Bd (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) surveillance and research is ongoing to understand disease dynamics in both the wild and captive population of Wyoming toads. This species is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation NeededIt is recommended that for occupied lakes, emergent and bank vegetation (bulrushes, sedges, grasses, etc.) be managed through grazing, prescribed burning, and mechanical removal, etc. to prevent overgrown vegetation that inhibits the free movement of toads and could potentially alter the thermal environment. A continued focus on captive breeding is required, and it is recommended that awareness and communication programmes surrounding this species' be expanded.Research NeededA better understanding of the life-history, disease dynamics, and ecological needs of the Wyoming Toad is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the reintroduction program.

In captivity, the female lays two or three eggs per clutch. The age of youngest breeding female was two years (del Hoyo 1994).","The extinction of this species had been forecast since its discovery. Ceaseless clearance of its lowland forest habitat, chiefly for sugarcane, and poaching had soon brought it to the verge of extinction. Sugarcane demand increased dramatically in the late 1970s, owing to a government programme to increase fuel alcohol production, hastening the destruction of remaining habitat. Pesticide-use in cane fields surrounding extant forest may also have had a detrimental effect. The last remaining area of reasonably extensive lowland forest in the region was virtually entirely cleared within six months in the late 1980s, while continued hunting served only to exacerbate the species's decline. The captive population, which was established from only three individuals, has been undergoing a severe bottleneck with a drastic decrease in genetic diversity (Costa et al. 2017). However, despite the loss of genetic diversity and the subsequent hybridization with M. tuberosum, several purebred M. mitu have persisted throughout the 35 years of captive breeding (Costa et al. 2017).","A captive population was established in Rio de Janeiro in 1977. Currently the population is kept in two aviaries, numbering over 100 purebred individuals and additionally around 40 hybrids of M. mitu and the Amazonian Razor-billed Curassow M. tuberosum (Pereira et al. 2014).

The reintroduction is scheduled to take place during 2018 (Lisboa 2017).","","Mitu mitu was endemic to the Pernambuco Centre of Endemism (Alagoas and Pernambuco, north-east Brazil), where it has almost certainly been extirpated. A report from north Bahia is unreliable. It went unreported between the mid-17th century, when found in Pernambuco, and 1951, when rediscovered around São Miguel dos Campos, Alagoas. Since the early 1970s, there are records from four forests in this region. Most likely, the species was uncommon and not widespread within its presumed historical distribution (Silveira et al. 2004): Numbers were probably as few as 20, even in the 1960s (del Hoyo 1994).

Ex situ stocks are currently maintained by institutions in Hungary, Czechia and Austria. Therefore, this species is assessed as Extinct in the Wild (EW).","This gregarious, thermophilic species inhabited a small (maximum recorded surface area c. 600 m2), shallow (maximum depth &lt; 2 metres) lake fed by a sublacustrine geothermal spring. Under natural conditions the mean annual water temperature in the lake was 29.1°C, but it became progressively colder after the 1960s as a result of the spring's discharge falling from 500 litres/second to 50 litres/second prior to the turn of the century (see 'Threats'). A number of additional springs and two other small lakes in the vicinity are also connected to the Peța River, but this species has not been recorded in any of them.The lake was heavily-vegetated and supported two other endemic taxa, comprising the melanopsid gastropod Microcolpia parreyssii, which has been globally extinct since the mid-2010s, and water lily subspecies Nymphaea lotus var. thermalis, small numbers of which survive at several other locations in the Peța River system.Racovitza's Rudd is omnivorous and feeds on aquatic invertebrates and algae, supplemented by smaller amounts of higher plant material.The annual reproductive period extends from February to March, and the eggs are deposited among submerged vegetation.","This species' extinction in the wild was caused by continued decline in the extent and quality of habitat over a period of several decades, culminating in the drying of Lake Pețea during September 2014.The primary driver of these events is understood to have been excessive abstraction of groundwater from the geothermal aquifer which feeds the Peța River. This water is partially utilised to heat local homes and guest houses, but also to supply business establishments associated with the wellness, recreational and therapeutic uses of the thermal waters, which are considered to have special properties due to the minerals they contain. The first dedicated tourist facilities were constructed during the 1970s, and extensive investment in new infrastructure during the 2000s prompted a shift from wellness to recreational tourism.The natural discharge of the geothermal aquifer began to decline after several artesian wells became operational during the 1980s, which caused some smaller springs to dry out. By the mid-2000s, water was being legally abstracted from 29 individual sites, while an undetermined number of illicit boreholes supplying private residences had also been drilled.Non-native fish taxa introduced to the Peța River include Topmouth Gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), Brown Bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and a number of ornamental species that were presumably released by aquarists. The presence of these is likely to have increased resource competition and predation pressure on the Racovitza's Rudd population.Moreover, the cooling water temperatures plausibly impacted recruitment by disrupting physiological processes associated with reproduction and altering the structure of planktonic and zoobenthic communities in the lake. Foraging and reproductive success may have been further compromised by agricultural (nutrients, pesticides and sediments) and domestic (garbage and wastewater) pollution from an affluent stream, which led to increased eutrophication, siltation and the development of a thick organic substrate layer due to overgrowth of the invasive plants Ceratopteris thalictroides, Bacopa sp. and Elodea sp..The population size of Racovitza's Rudd is thus believed to have been somewhat reduced prior to dewatering of the lake, which took place over a period of several years. The sublacustrine source spring first became inactive during December 2011, when a sudden decline in depth and surface area was observed. Flow was briefly reestablished in spring 2012, but by the end of that year the lake had been reduced to a small pond measuring a few metres in diameter which was maintained only by intermittent pumping of water from a nearby borehole. These conditions were exacerbated by a series of consecutive dry summers, and in September 2014 the lake completely dried out. This pattern has been repeated in subsequent years, with active groundwater discharge restricted to a short period each spring. By 2017, the number of operational extraction wells had fallen by more than half, indicating severe depletion of the geothermal aquifer.","This species' wild population became extinct in September 2014, following an extended period of declining habitat quality (see 'Threats'). A number of ex situ subpopulations are currently established (see 'Conservation').","","This species was endemic to a single small lake fed by a geothermal spring in the vicinity of Oradea, Bihor County, northwestern Romania. The lake, known locally as Pețea or Ochiul Mare, is located in the upper reaches of the Peța River, a minor left-bank tributary of the Crișul Repede (hu. Sebes-Körös) River in the upper Tisza River system. The Tisza is itself a major affluent of the Danube River.",This species is not used or traded.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is included in Appendix III of the Bern Convention (as Rutilus racovitzai).Lake Pețea and the surrounding area lie within the boundaries of a protected area created in 1932, which was added to the European Union's Natura 2000 network in 2007 (site ROSCI0098). Racovitza's Rudd is not listed as a target species.In 2012, fears over deteriorating habitat quality resulted in 60 individuals, comprising 58 females and 2 males, being collected from the wild and transferred to the Țării Crișurilor Museum in Oradea with the aid of financial support from the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. Some of these individuals were later transferred to the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE, formerly Szent István University) in Budapest, Hungary, where reproduction was artificially induced. Around 5,000 individuals were successfully reared as a result of these efforts, which were split between several institutions in order to establish multiple ex situ subpopulations. As of early 2024, stocks are maintained at the Țării Crișurilor Museum (Oradea, Romania), Răsvan Angheluțăq Museum of Natural Sciences (Galați, Romania), MATE, Schönbrunn Zoo (Vienna, Austria), Plzeň Zoo (Plzeň, Czechia) and Tropicarium (Budapest, Hungary).The Lake Pețea ecosystem and its endemic fauna and flora were targeted by the 'Conservation and protection of ecosystems endangered by lack of thermal and freshwater in crossborder area' project, which took place from 2018-2021 and was co-funded by the European Union within the Interreg Europe interregional cooperation programme (project code ROHU-29). A series of useful studies and conservation activities were completed through a collaboration between the Oradea Metropolitan Development Association, University of Oradea, Aqua Crisius Angling Association and the HUN-REN Institute for Nuclear Research (Debrecen, Hungary), although none of them resulted in long-term outcomes for Racovitza's Rudd.The reestablishment of this species in the wild is currently precluded by a lack of stable hydrological conditions at the former Lake Pețea, the restoration of which should be treated as a conservation priority. The development of sustainable water abstraction protocols is likely to represent the most effective initial management strategy. If the lake's water level can be restored, a period of monitoring should ideally be implemented in order to assess its ecological status prior to any direct reintroduction efforts.",Palearctic,2014,false,false,Global & Europe

In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba Dam in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River blocked the migration route, preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches to spawn. Juveniles were last recorded in the upper reaches of the river in 1992, suggesting that few individuals might have been able to survive and reproduce above the dam. The last individual was observed in 2003. Despite intense surveys, no remaining individuals have been detected and there is no chance that such a large and enigmatic species has survived unnoticed.

The species occurred in the main stem of large rivers, staying usually in middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swimming into large lakes. Its spawning period was in March and April. Spawning sites were located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Available information also indicates that spawning took place in the lower Jinsha River between Shuifu and Yibin (Liu and Zeng 1988, Li et al. 1997). Psephurus gladius was a piscivorous species, and the largest individual recorded was 7 m in length and weighed over several thousand pounds.","The Chinese Paddlefish was heavily overfished. Even fry of Psephurus gladius, forming schools along the river, were easily captured in traditional Chinese fishing nets and set nets (Zhang et al. 2009). All age classes were taken whenever possible. Its long generation time (e.g. late sexual maturation and large size) made it very vulnerable to overharvest.In 1981 the Gezhouba Dam was built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, blocking the migration route and preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn. Due to early depletion of the stocks and the difficulties to keep it in aquaculture, no ex situ population was established.","The species is now extinct (Zhang et al. 2020).

The last reliable wild record dates from 1900, and a search beginning in 1910 failed to find it.","It was a nomadic species, breeding and foraging in vast flocks millions of birds strong. It exploited seasonally available crops of beechmast, acorns and chestnuts; scouting for food sources and infomation sharing was likely to have required flocks of a certain critical size, below which survival would be compromised. Birds nested in April or May in vast colonies typically 16 by 5 km in size.","The precise cause of its extinction is difficult to determine, but the widespread clearance of the hardwood trees which provided its mast food, and the proliferation of the rail network and telegraph system which enabled efficient location of nesting colonies and the transport of young birds to market are probably the two single most important factors. Other important factors were excessive shooting, Newcastle disease, and towards the last of their years, the breakdown of social facilitation (Halliday 1980, Blockstein and Tordoff 1985, Bucher 1992).",None remain.,"","Ectopistes migratorius was found in forest in eastern and central Canada and the USA, occasionally wandering south to Mexico and Cuba.

Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant, the species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild. The species's decline was primarily the result of trapping for trade plus habitat loss.","It was found in the caatinga scrub zone, apparently requiring gallery woodland dominated by caraiba Tabebuia caraiba trees for nesting, but feeding mainly on two regionally characteristic Euphorbiaceae plant species. Breeding occurred during the austral summer. Two or three eggs were laid in the wild (up to five in captivity). The wild bird and the P. maracana apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid.","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros et. al. 2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros et. al. 2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart et. al. 2018).,"","This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw Propyrrhura maracana, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female C. spixii was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line (Caparroz et al. 2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female P. maracana in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros in litt. 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity.

Extensive searches in the appropriate habitat, during the appropriate season within the known range, since 1964 have failed to locate this species.","This species occurred in primary forest in the Atlantic Forest biome. It inhabited low vegetation on the border of streams in gallery forest (Bokermann 1963). There is no information on breeding habits, but reproduction might have taken place by larval development in streams. It was a medium-sized treefrog with loud and very characteristic vocalizations, making it easy to detect.","This species disappeared in the late 1960s or 1970s after suffering severe declines due to a number of threats. Both known sites have been destroyed by infrastructure development. The type locality was destroyed when the new Estação Ferroviária Campo Grande (railway station) was built in the early 1970s. The second locality was previously on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo, and was destroyed by significant urban expansion that took place during the middle of the last century (1950s–1970s) and continues to this day. This site is currently a parking lot (P. Garcia pers. comm. 2021).However, the Serra da Paranapiacaba still contains a large extent of  intact, suitable forest habitat and the species likely occurred at other sites within the Serra, and between the Serra and the city of Sao Paulo. It is the synergistic effects of pollution, disease, and habitat degradation that are suspected to have caused the species' extinction where habitat loss did not (Carvalho et al. 2017). The coastal city of Cubatão is highly industrialized and contains oil and gas refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, and other industrial activities. It infamously caused severe air pollution in the city of Sao Paulo in the 1970s and 1980s. The resulting acid rain caused changes in forest cover and humidity in the forests of the Serra da Paranapiacaba and Serra do Mar (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is thought to have arrived in the Serra do Mar in the 1970s or 1980s (Carvalho et al. 2017). The overlap in the timing of these threats, and their extreme severity, are thought to have caused rapid declines across the entire distribution.","This species is known from five individuals collected in 1962 from the type locality (Bokermann 1963, Lutz 1973, Faivovich et al. 2021). Only one individual is known from the Nova Manchester locality and was identified from museum collections by Faivovich et al.

Bokermann who collected the type series, but all were unsuccessful (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The Serra de Paranapiacaba is the type locality of many other species, and occurs within the broader Serra do Mar of Sao Paulo State, which has been subject to hundreds of surveys over the decades. The second site was on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo in the 1960s, but has since been engulfed by urbanisation and has been destroyed.

Associated native plant species included Artemisia australis, Bidens forbesii, Eragrostis variabilis, Euphorbia spp., Hibiscus kokio subsp. saintjohnianus, Pandanus tectorius, Polyscias racemosa, and Psydrax odorata.","Major threats that contributed to the decline of this taxon in the wild included predation and habitat degradation by non-native animals, particularly goats that eat the plants and increase landslides in the natural cliff side habitat. Non-native, invasive plant taxa, such as Ficus sp., Lantana camara, Melinis sp., Psidium cattleianum, Schinus terebinthifolius, Syzygium cumini, continuously contribute to the displacement of native habitat for possible recruitment of Brighamia insignis. A severe lack of pollination occurring combined with predominately self-incompatibility, is also a major factor to the decline of this taxon. The loss of its pollinator(s) is suspected; this is believed to have been a hawkmoth based on the species floral biology (Walsh et al. 2019). In addition, Fortini et al. (2013) characterized this taxon as extremely vulnerable to climate change (vulnerability index 0.867).

Multiple methods for determining the likelihood of extinction have used the sighting history of this species as a test dataset and each has determined that the species is extinct beyond reasonable doubt. The probability of the species being extinct from these models first exceeded 95% during the period between 1989 and the start of 2005. Separately, an expert-led assessment of the probability of extinction based on the severity and spatial extent of threats concluded there was 90% probability that it was extinct. Considering the last confirmed sighting of the species was in 1985 despite adequate survey of remaining habitat within the potential range, and in view of the threats to the species, its lack of mobility and restricted range, this species is considered to be Extinct.","Behaviour This species was presumed to be strongly sedentary since its small wings render it unable to fly long distances. Some movements to highland lakes and ponds other than Lake Alaotra were thought to have occurred as a result of the degradation of its preferred habitat, as opposed to representing habitual movement (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It was usually found in pairs, sometimes in association with T. ruficollis (Langrand 1990). It was thought to have a flexible breeding season, with historical records of breeding in April-June and in January-March (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat Lake Alaotra is a large, shallow, brackish lake. Its shores were historically covered with dense vegetation including papyrus and reeds, which may have been important for this species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet It fed almost exclusively on fish (Langrand 1990). Breeding site Nothing was known of its breeding ecology (Langrand 1990).","Several major factors contributed to this species' extinction. The primary driver of the rapid population reduction and loss of most individuals is considered to be the introduction of the carnivorous fish Micropterus salmoides and Channa striata (ZICOMA 1999), which caused adult mortality but more significantly reduced reproduction to near-zero. These fish were introduced to the Alaotra basin in the 1950s and very rapid population declines appear to have commenced shortly afterwards. Additional introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially Tilapia, probably depleted essential foods for the species (Pidgeon 1996). Conversion of natural habitat for agriculture also occurred at an increasing rate during this time, with deforestation resulting in sedimentation from soil erosion and water quality being lowered, and considerable area has been converted to rice farms (Wilmé 1994). The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra proliferated more recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared (Hawkins et al. 2000). The final few individuals may have been lost through hybridisation with T. ruficollis, although this appears to have been occurring for a long time as the type series from 1932 includes a presumed hybrid (Delacour 1932, Collar and Stuart 1985, Hawkins et al. 2000). Poaching may also have played a role in the extinction of the species (Wilmé 1994), although larger-bodied waterbirds are thought to have always been the primary target of hunters (Hawkins et al. 2000).","The species was described in 1932 from Lake Alaotra (Delacour 1932) and in 1960 grebe flocks on the lake contained c. 50 individuals alongside Little Grebe T. ruficollis and Madagascar Little Grebe T. pelzelnii, but also a number of hybrids with T. ruficollis (Voous and Payne 1965, Collar and Stuart 1985). Thirteen specimens were collected at this time (Voous and Payne 1965), presumably out of the total of 50 (Hawkins et al. 2000). Numerous other reports from a wider area are given in Collar and Stuart (1985), but none were documented and were subsequently considered to be in error for T. pelzelnii. In 1982 c. 12 individuals were identified as still present, along with several hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Two or three individuals were then recorded in 1985 near Andreba on Lake Alaotra, when the only known photographs of the species in the wild was taken (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson. in litt. 2022). There have been no further confirmed sightings despite considerable survey effort (Hawkins et al. 2000). The sighting series for the species has been used in the development of models to determine extinction probability using both linear modelling and Bayesian approaches (Lee et al. 2014, Thompson et al. 2017, 2019): these all conclude the species became extinct prior to 1995. Separately, an assessment of the likely impact of the combination of threats faced by the species concluded that the severity and extent indicated a 90% probability of extinction for the species (Keith et al. 2017).","","Tachybaptus rufolavatus was endemic to Madagascar and known chiefly from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999). There have been no confirmed sightings since 1985 when two were seen (in addition to several apparent hybrids) near Andreba on Lake Alaotra in September 1985 (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson in litt. 2022). After this an adult and an immature were reported as the species in 1986 (B. Dawson, unpublished report) and two individuals (also an adult and an immature) which may have been Alaotra Grebe were again reported in 1988 (D. Thorn, unpublished report) but these were not documented and may have been hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Survey visits to Lake Alaotra in 1989-90 (Young and Smith 1989, Wilmé 1994) 1993 and 1994 (Pidgeon 1996), then 1997-1999 failed to produce any sightings, prompting a targeted survey in 1999 which only located four T. pelzelnii (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Visits in 2000 found no individuals (of this or any species of Tachybaptus) on Lake Alaotra or surrounding lakes, and further surveys drew blanks in 2004 and 2009 (H. G. Young in litt. 2009). Records outside the Lake Alaotra region were unreliable as species was probably incapable of prolonged flight, so in all likelihood never occurred very far from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Checks of additional potential sites, in particular Lake Amparihinandriamabavy (F. Hawkins in litt. 2009), have failed to find any grebes. It is now considered extinct, as no suitable wetlands remain unsurveyed in the Alaotra region (H. G. Young in litt. 2009).","Some deliberate take of the species for food has been reported (Wilmé 1994), although larger waterbirds were more likely targets than the much smaller bodied grebes (Hawkins et al. 2000).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"",Afrotropical,1985,false,false,Global

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, H. affinis was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","Hemignathus affinis inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000 m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott et al. 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to H. hanapepe in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Conant et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 1995). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for H. affinis and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa Akialoa lanaiensis, that occupied somewhat similar niches to H. affinis, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.","After no sightings for more than 60 years, Hemignathus affinis was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of Chlorodrepanis virens and possibly Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.91, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct. In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. affinis from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","","Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that H. affinis was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where G. floridana was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover G. floridana have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann et al. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by Thompson et al. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the  Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable. See attached Supplementary Information document for further details.",Govenia floridana is a terrestrial orchid that grew in deep hummus on the forest floor of heavily shaded tropical hardwood hammock habitat in Everglades National Park. It was reported to flower between November and December (Luer 1972).,"Poaching and trampling of the site by collectors may have contributed to this orchid’s decline and eventual disappearance from its only known locality (Gann 2015). In 1960 Hurricane Donna significantly altered conditions in the single hardwood hammock where this species occurred, increasing light penetration to the forest floor and causing an increase in understory vegetation. Altered conditions did not appear to have an immediate impact on the population of Govenia floridana, but may have contributed to its decline (Luer 1972). Long Pine Key, where this orchid was located, is protected within Everglades National Park. However, development and habitat degradation in South Florida has resulted in the loss of most potentially suitable hardwood hammock habitat outside the park (Loope and Avery 1979). ","When discovered in 1957, the only known population of Govenia floridana consisted of 25 individuals.

During the daytime, it sheltered in a grass-lined nest or a short straight burrow with a grass-lined nest at the end. In north-western Victoria, it occurred on grassy plains and in other places it favoured open woodland with a shrub and grass understorey. When disturbed, it often took refuge in a hollow log (Burbidge et al. 1988, Fisher 1988, Johnson and Burbidge 2008). Its diet included grass, bulbous roots, insects, and possibly other small vertebrates. More than any other bandicoot, the tooth and gut structures indicate a herbivorous diet, even a degree of grazing (Johnson and Burbidge 2008).","The relative contribution of potential causal factors to the extinction of the Southern Pig-footed Bandicoot is not well resolved. Menkhorst (2009) reported it had declined almost to local extinction in north-western Victoria by the 1850s, well before the advent of red foxes or rabbits, and possibly before feral cats were present there. This decline corresponded to the arrival of livestock (mostly sheep) and the habitat change and degradation due to their unsustainably high densities. However, the Southern Pig-footed Bandicoot subsequently disappeared from many areas not degraded by livestock, and predation by introduced red fox and feral cat is a plausible cause. Changed fire regimes, associated with loss of Indigenous land management, may also be implicated (Menkhorst 2009).

Ramos remains forested and appears to be free of introduced predators, although hunters from the adjacent islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita make regular journeys to harvest the nesting Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica, and may have shot ground-doves on these expeditions (Buckingham et al. 1995, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1998, D. Gibbs in litt. 1999).",No extant population remains.,"","This species is known from just two specimens from the Solomon Islands, one from Makira (= San Cristobal) taken in 1882 and the other from Ramos (c.4 ha) in 1927. Although the Makira locality has been queried, it is thought to be valid (D. Gibbs in litt. 1999). Surveys looking for this species on Makira (Buckingham et al. 1995, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1998, D. Gibbs in litt. 1999, R. James in litt. 1999) were unsuccessful. Recent surveys on Ramos also failed to find any individuals and the species was not known to landowners (G. Dutson in litt. 2004). There is now no longer any reasonable doubt that the last individual has died, probably some time ago. It is likely that it once occurred on other islands in the region. It may have been a tramp species of small islands with occasional birds occurring on larger islands, or the two specimens may just represent the last individuals of a declining population (Lees 1991, Buckingham et al. 1995).",This species was hunted.,Terrestrial,"",Australasian,1927,false,false,Global

229337053,60095,Urolophus javanicus,Extinct,,2023,2023-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Java Stingaree (Urolophus javanicus) is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia. The species’ full distribution and habitat is undefined but given a lack of records in surrounding areas it is assumed to have had a restricted range in the Java Sea. The species was small, with the only known specimen measuring 33.8 cm total length. Based on size, the maturity of the holotype cannot be inferred. The Java Stingaree was one of only two stingaree species in Indonesia and is believed to be unique within the Java region and nearby areas. Rays are heavily exploited and utilized in Indonesia, making up 60% of the national total elasmobranch (shark and ray) catch. Intensive, generally unregulated fishing was likely the major threat resulting in the depletion of the Java Stingaree population, with coastal fisheries catches already declining in the 1870s. Catches on the northern coast of Java in 1940 were down to almost half the annual catch landed in the 1860s. Additionally, the northern coast of Java, particularly Jakarta Bay, is heavily industrialized, and extensive habitat loss and degradation may also have impacted this species. Coastal habitats likely utilized by the Java Stingaree have been replaced with aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s. The life history of the Java Stingaree is not known, however urolophids are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (as low as 1–2 pups/year). The species was therefore likely highly susceptible to population reduction and depletion. Despite extensive survey efforts since 2001 including monitoring of fish landing sites along the northern coast of Java (including Jakarta), as well as elsewhere in Indonesia, no further specimens have been recorded. Previously assessed in 2021 as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (CR(PE)), a reassessment has been undertaken with further information on threats and survey effort.The Framework for using the Threats Model and the Records and Surveys Model to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction, and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species, were both extremely high. The Java Sea and surrounding waters have a long history of fisheries development and fishing effort has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985. The probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.00). There have been no planned species-specific surveys, but there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of sharks and rays in general in Java since 2001. It is highly likely that these surveys would have recorded the species if it were present given the Java Stingaree’s uniqueness within the Java Sea region and surrounds. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.97 (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). Both model results are &gt;0.9 and therefore the Java Stingaree meets the threshold for the Extinct category.","The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype, a female of 33.8 cm total length (TL)/19.1 cm disc width (DW) collected from a fish market in Jakarta, Indonesia (Martens 1864). The size of this specimen falls within the known range of female size-at-maturity for urolophids (20–50 cm TL across nine species; Last et al. 2016), and therefore maturity of the holotype cannot be inferred. Its previous habitat is unknown, however stingarees generally inhabit waters of the continental and insular shelves while a few species occur in deeper slope waters to 430 m depth (Last et al. 2016). The Java Sea is relatively flat (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) and this topography offers relatively little variability in habitats available to species in this region.The life history of the species is unknown, but urolophids have some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays, with five studied species producing 1–2 pups per year (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). Urolophids reproduce annually or biennially, with long gestation lengths of at least 10–12 months and up to 19 months (Last et al. 2016). Urolophid embryos are also readily aborted upon capture (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016), indicating a reduction in reproductive potential in heavily fished regions even if released alive after capture. The Java Stingaree is therefore likely to have had limited resilience to overexploitation.","Demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia for decades (Stobutzki et al. 2006), if not consistently since the 1870s when declines were first reported (Yuwono 2001). Indonesia has also been the world’s largest shark and ray producer and exporter of fins and meat since 1998, and ranked among the top 20 shark fishing nations since 1980 (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo et al. 2021). Sharks and rays are captured and retained in targeted fisheries and as bycatch across Indonesia (White and Dharmadi 2007, Booth et al. 2018, Clark-Shen et al. 2022). The historical range of the Java Stingaree is subject to intense inshore fishing pressure, which is largely unregulated, and the relatively shallow waters of the Java Sea (mean depth 50 m; Koropitan and Ikeda 2008) provide no refuge at depth. The Java Sea demersal coastal fishery catch was declining by the end of the 1800s (Yuwono 2001), and from 1976 to 1997 the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings (Blaber et al. 2009). Total fishing effort in Indonesia has likely exceeded maximum sustainable yield since at least 1985 (Squires et al. 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). Despite this, until recently fisheries policies aimed to increase fishing capacity, causing declines in stocks and catch rates of sharks and rays throughout Indonesia (Squires et al. 2003, Fahmi and Dharmadi 2015). The Java Sea is currently Indonesia’s second largest Fisheries Management Area in terms of catch (tonnes) and produces significantly higher ray landings than sharks (Prasetyo et al. 2021). Ray species of the family Dasyatidae make up the majority of ray catches in Indonesia (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi et al. 2009, Booth et al. 2018, Prasetyo et al. 2021), many of which would be predicted to occupy the same habitats and interact with the same fishing gears as the Java Stingaree. Rays are captured and usually retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries in Indonesia which use a range of fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook-and-line, trap, and seine net (White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber et al. 2009, Dharmadi et al. 2015). The high market value of many shark and ray products, particularly fins, makes targeted fishing a profitable venture, and fishers are incentivized to retain sharks and rays (Booth et al. 2018, D’Alberto et al. 2022).Shallow inshore waters around the Indo-Malay Archipelago are also threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki et al. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). Approximately 90% of Jakarta Bay’s shoreline has been modified for development, including urban, industrial, agricultural, or aquaculture purposes (Bengen et al. 2006), with the destruction of mangrove habitats for aquaculture ponds beginning in the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). In Jakarta, services and infrastructure such as sewage and wastewater treatment plants are not capable of facilitating the whole human population, leading to pollution of waterways surrounding the megacity (Dsikowitzky et al. 2016). As a result, coastal ecosystems of the heavily industrialized Jakarta Bay are significantly degraded through habitat loss (including the Jakarta Reclamation Project), increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination which has resulted in mercury bioaccumulation in rays in Jakarta Bay (see Hosono et al. 2011 and references within; Budiyanto et al. 2015). Coastal habitats have also undergone degradation as a result of destructive fishing practices (Booth et al. 2018). Species occurring in small geographic ranges are generally more sensitive to threatening processes (Joppa et al. 2016), and the stressors on the aquatic environment surrounding the growing Jakarta region are intense and ever-increasing.","The only known Java Stingaree specimen was a female collected in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1862, and since then considerable survey effort in Indonesia, particularly since 2001, has failed to locate further specimens. Extensive surveys of landing sites and fish markets have been conducted in Indonesia (e.g., Adrim and Fahmi 2007, White and Dharmadi 2007, Fahmi et al. 2008, Fahmi 2012, Ernawati et al. 2015, Tirtadanu et al. 2018, Simeon et al. 2017, Simeon et al. 2018, Simeon et al. 2021, Yuwandana et al. 2019). Shark and ray catches at Indonesian landing sites are also continually monitored by trained government agencies and non-governmental organizations (e.g., Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center [SEAFDEC], Rekam Nusantara Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Society [WCS]) and no contemporary specimens, photographs, or genetic evidence of the species have been found. Despite &gt;28,000 individual rays being examined in Indonesian landing sites (including Jakarta) between 2001 and 2006 (White and Dharmadi 2007), and extensive surveys in Indonesia (including the Java Sea region) between 2007 and 2022, the Java Stingaree has not been recorded (Supplementary Information). The majority of ray catch at major landing sites is made up of rays from the family Dasyatidae (White and Dharmadi 2007, Dharmadi et al. 2009, Booth et al. 2018, Prasetyo et al. 2021). This includes individuals as small as 9.1 cm disc width (DW) (Hemitrygon longicauda [referred to as Dasyatis sp. 1]) and 9.2 cm DW (Telatrygon biasa [Dasyatis zugei], Brevitrygon javaensis [Himantura cf. walga]) (White and Dharmadi 2007). Because even low-value products are landed for markets such as salted or smoked meat, fishmeal, and pet food, it is very likely that, if extant, further Java Stingaree specimens would have been taken to landing sites if captured and subsequently recorded by observers. The species was also not recorded in trawl surveys in the Java Sea at depths of 15–70 m in 2015 and 2017, which recorded several species of rays, also dominated by stingrays of the family Dasyatidae (Ernawati et al. 2015, Tirtadanu et al. 2018).Since the only Java Stingaree specimen was collected at a fish market, the species’ geographic range limits and habitat have not been defined. Most other urolophid species have restricted geographic ranges and/or are restricted to a single country (see Last et al. 2016). A restricted range is assumed for the Java Stingaree due to a lack of records from adjacent islands which are also monitored and the general pattern of small geographic range size in this family. In the 1860s, fishers were limited by fishing technology and the size and facilities of their fishing vessels. Javan fishing vessels were too small to provide spaces for catch to be preserved or salted onboard, so fishers generally remained within 40 km of the coastline, and it is likely that fishing grounds worked from Jakarta in the late 1800s did not exceed more than one-third of the Java Sea (Yuwono 2001). The Java Stingaree holotype was collected as a fresh specimen at a landing site (Martens 1864) and was therefore likely collected within 40 km seaward of Jakarta. It is unlikely that the species was restricted to an area as small as Jakarta Bay, but it is reasonable to assume it may have been restricted to the Java Sea. Therefore, for this assessment, the threats and surveys that encompass the Java Sea and the northern coast of Java were considered.The Framework (Akçakaya et al. 2017) for using the Threats Model (Keith et al. 2017) and the Records and Surveys Model (Thompson et al. 2017) to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. The Models were developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be applied under a range of possible scenarios including to calculate the probability of extinction (P(E)) for rare species with a limited number of records over an observed time series. The Threats Model considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the species’ life history characteristics to determine the probability that a species is extinct (Keith et al. 2017). Indonesia represents the world’s largest shark fishing nation by catch (Lack and Sant 2009, Dent and Clarke 2015, Prasetyo et al. 2021). Fisheries in Java have a long history, with the first reports of coastal fishery resources becoming depleted by the late 1800s (Yuwono 2001). Unregulated small-scale fisheries and large-scale commercial trawls since the 1970s have driven recent overexploitation in the region, and the Java Sea underwent a 90% decline in ray landings from 1976 to 1997 (Blaber et al. 2009). There are numerous large fishing ports and landing sites in Java, and local depletion of shark and ray resources in the Java Sea have led local fishers to access resources further afield (e.g., Kalimantan, Papua). Java is the world’s most populated island with a population of over 140 million people, the majority of which are located on the northern coast of Java. Jakarta is a growing megacity with intense levels of human pressure on coastal habitats and resources. Jakarta Bay is heavily industrialized and coastal ecosystems are significantly degraded through habitat loss, increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination. Mangrove habitats have been replaced with industrial areas, urban areas, and aquaculture ponds since the early 1900s (Yuwono 2001, Pribadi pers. comm. 2023). Further habitat destruction has resulted from government policy, namely the Reclamation Policy of 1995 and the subsequent Jakarta Reclamation Project beginning in 2015.The life history of the Java Stingaree is unknown, however urolophids are well-studied and are characterized by some of the lowest fecundities among sharks and rays (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). Gestation length is considered relatively long, spanning at least 10–12 months (Last et al. 2016), and reproductive potential is considered low (White et al. 2001, Kyne et al. 2016). The species is therefore considered highly susceptible to population decline as a result of threats. Consequently, the probability that the combination of threats affecting the Java Stingaree occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction P(local) and the probability that the threats occurred over the entire range of the species P(spatial) were both extremely high (minimum = 0.90; best = 0.95; maximum = 1.0). As a result, the probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.9 or 90% (minimum = 0.81; maximum = 1.0).The Records and Surveys Model estimates the probability that a species is extinct based on a time series of known records of the species, and the timing, extent, and species-specific adequacy of surveys (Thompson et al. 2017). The species is known from a single record, the holotype collected in 1862. p(ci) (the probability that the species was correctly identified as extant) was therefore set at 1 (lower; best; upper) as per guidelines in the Instructions (see the Instructions document on the IUCN Red List website). The proportion of the species’ range covered by passive surveys (epsilon) was set at a moderate level (epsilon: lower = 0.4; best = 0.5; upper = 0.6) due to the restricted range of the species and extensive coverage by fishers who fish daily and usually land catches locally. The probability that the species would have been recorded (p(r)) or reliably identified (p(i)) in passive surveys was low (p(r): lower = 0.1; best = 0.15; upper = 0.2; p(i): lower = 0; best = 0.1; upper = 0.2) due to the rarity, small-size, and low economic value of the Java Stingaree, and lack of species-level knowledge held by fishers, as per the Instructions.There have been no surveys targeted specifically at locating further specimens of this species, however, there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of elasmobranchs in general in Java, and it is highly likely that these surveys would have documented the presence of the Java Stingaree if it had been caught. It is worth noting that these surveys have recorded many rare species, including many rare ray species (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007). An intensive focus on survey effort for elasmobranchs commenced in 2001 (see White and Dharmadi 2007) and some form of survey in West Java, Central Java, Jakarta, and/or the Java Sea has taken place near annually since (Supplementary Information). Monitoring landing sites is a standard approach to surveying fishes in Asia and is very effective for documenting catches and species given the pooling of ‘samples’ at one location. Landing site surveys in Indonesia since 2001 have resulted in the description of over 20 new shark and ray species (White et al. 2006). Landing site surveys are likely to have included catch from throughout the likely depth range of the Java Stingaree. Prior to 2001, there had been little dedicated survey effort since the early ichthyological expeditions of the 1800s (see White et al. 2006). Surveys that occurred in Jakarta, the Java Sea, or the northern coast of West Java and Central Java were included in the Records and Surveys Model, while surveys in the same area examining landings from fisheries unlikely to interact with the Java Stingaree (e.g., pelagic longlines) were excluded. Pelagic longlines, for example, are unlikely to capture demersal species such as urolophids because they are not bottom-set.The proportion of the species’ range that was covered by dedicated surveys varied each year, with an average best value of 0.46 (epsilon best ranging from 0.15–0.9). The proportion of geographic range surveyed was increased for some years from the previous assessment (Kyne et al. 2021), taking into account the number of landing sites surveyed for that year and any fisheries-independent surveys. Since landing site surveys in Jakarta and Java more broadly monitor catches arriving from throughout the Java Sea and adjacent waters (Fahmi pers. obs. 2021), the proportion of the species’ geographic range surveyed is higher in years with multiple landing site surveys. Javan fishers may possibly land their catches outside of this area, and although not included in surveys for this assessment, these landing sites have also not recorded another Java Stingaree individual.The probability that the Java Stingaree would have been recorded in these surveys (p(r)) was set with a best value of 0.3 each year (lower = 0.2; upper = 0.4) following the suggested default values given in the Instructions for rare species (see Table 3 in the Instructions document). The probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the survey if it were recorded (p(i)) was set with a best value of 0.8 each year (lower = 0.7; upper = 0.9) based on the Instructions for species that are not particularly difficult to identify or distinguish from similar species, and that were searched for by seemingly competent surveyors (see Table 4 in the Instructions document). These values were chosen based on the Instructions because the species is the sole member of the family Urolophidae occurring in Java; the only other species in Indonesia is the Kai Stingaree (Urolophus kaianus) from far eastern Indonesia (Last et al. 2016). Although the stingray fauna (family Dasyatidae) is diverse in Indonesia, misidentification by trained surveyors is unlikely to have occurred as urolophids are easily distinguishable from dasyatids due to their short tails with an obvious elongate lobe-like caudal fin (Last et al. 2016).The probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct from the Records and Surveys Model is 0.97, or 97% (minimum = 0.67; maximum = 1.0). The overall probability that the Java Stingaree is extinct in 2023 is the average of the results for both Models, which is 0.94 or 94%. The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.93 for both weighting methods. The Models also separately calculate the probability that the species is extant (P(Xt)) each year over the observation period (1862–2023). The probability that the Java Stingaree is extant in 2023 is 0.03 or 3%. Both model results are &gt;0.9, and therefore fall within the threshold for the Extinct category.This species has been reassessed due to expert opinion of the assessors that some of the parameters used in the previous assessment were set too low. The parameters which were changed from the previous assessment (Kyne et al. 2021) were P(local), P(spatial), and epsilon for dedicated surveys. The assessors each determined their best estimates for the extent and duration of threats (P(local) and P(spatial)) occurring throughout the Java Sea, and these individual estimates were used to determine the best estimates for this assessment. The proportion of geographic range surveyed (epsilon) was also increased for some of the survey years. This was based on consideration of the often very large geographic areas used by fishers delivering catches to landing sites. The estimates of epsilon for this assessment were therefore made by considering the number of landing sites surveyed in a particular year, and whether any fisheries-independent surveys also occurred in that year. Given that the geographic range of the Java Stingaree could have been restricted to a portion of the Java Sea (rather than the entire Java Sea as used in this assessment), the approach that was used to estimate epsilon is considered conservative. This reassessment also included updated recent survey effort for the years 2021 and 2022.For further information, see the Supplementary Information.","","The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia in the Western Central Pacific (Martens 1864, Last et al. 2016). The full geographic extent of the species’ historical range is uncertain, but the Java Stingaree was presumed to have had a relatively restricted distribution in the Java Sea due to a lack of records in surrounding areas. Further, the capability of fishing vessels in the 1800s (Yuwono 2001) indicate that the holotype was likely collected within 40 km of Jakarta’s shoreline.","Rays are heavily exploited and utilized in Indonesia, and are caught and retained in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries for their meat and skin (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber et al. 2009, Dharmadi et al. 2015, Booth et al. 2018, D’Alberto et al. 2022). As the only known specimen was collected from a fish market (Martens 1864), the species is likely to have been utilized when caught. The meat of small, lower value species is often consumed in coastal communities as salted or smoked fish (Booth et al. 2018). There is a demand for ray meat on the northern coast of Java due to the growing human population, with smoked rays popular in cities along the coast (B. Simeon pers. obs. 2023).

Simeon pers. obs. 2023) and there are no current management or conservation actions related to artisanal ray fisheries in Indonesia.

By the 13th century, the Aurochs survived only in small numbers in Eastern Europe, where hunting it became a privilege of nobles and later royals (van Vuure 2005). In Poland the Aurochs was no longer common by the 13th century and the last herd survived in the Jaktorów forest, Masuria, where it was strictly protected by royal decree and hunting Aurochs was strictly reserved for kings under pain of death (Swiecicki 1634).

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900 m, mainly 1,200-1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger et al. 2020). Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie Freycinetia arborea, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger et al. 1998).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats, primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source, ‘ie‘ie vine Freycinetia arborea (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of Culex will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, have not been seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022).","There have been unconfirmed reports of Ou up to 1996, but no confirmed records since 1989. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.984, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.941. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. Historically Ou were widespread across much of the Hawaiian Archipelago, but were extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). The last confirmed record on Hawai'i was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998) while the last confirmed record on Kauai was 1989 (Pyle 1986).","","Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J. Lepson in litt. 1999).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes however there are records of the green feathers of Ou being utilised occasionally (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","While the most recent records were all in rainforest and only a few in weedy forest (Higgins et al. 2006), they were historically recorded nesting in orchards (Hull 1910) and red guava Pisidium cattleianum trees and feeding on fruits of olives Olea europaea (Mees 1969) and insects (Christian 2005).","Threats for this species have operated at an acuity and spatial scale that have driven it extinct. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability it is extant based on threats is 0.02 (Clarke et al. 2021). The principal threat was predation by black rats Rattus rattus which are thought to have been introduced in the mid-1940s (Robinson 1988). Most other Zosterops species persist alongside rats, including two other species on Norfolk Island, but rats appear to have exterminated the Robust White-eye Z. strenuus within ten years of colonising Lord Howe Island (Hindwood 1940, Sharland 1929). The effects of predation have been exacerbated by the clearance of much native forest and invasion of the remainder by exotic weeds. Although being baited on the ground in the National Park since the early 1990s, rats have remained common in trees and shrubs and their arboreal behaviour renders such control programs less effective (Nance et al. 2023b). Loss of good habitat to agriculture, predation by cats Felis catus and competition from the self-introduced Silvereye Zosterops lateralis, first recorded on the island in 1904, may have contributed to the white-eye’s decline but are unlikely to be primary causes (Clarke et al. 2021).","While common and widespread in 1908 (Hull 1910) and 1926 (Mees 1969), it was very scarce in 1962, with a population estimated at &lt;50 birds, and only two birds were seen in 1968 (Mees 1969). Four records during an island-wide survey in 1979 were the last multi-observer records (Schodde et al. 1983). Formal searches in the 1980s and in 2009 (Dutson 2013) failed to find the species, but poorly documented reports (detailed in Dutson 2013) suggested persistence. There have been no records since 2009 and from 2017 to 2019 postgraduate students spending three months a year working in prime white-eye habitat on the island and have seen none (R. Clarke unpublished, in Clarke et al. 2021).

It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.

The primary cause of decline was probably predation by feral cats (Felis catus) (Dickman et al. 1993), but resource depletion and habitat change due to clearing, livestock, changed fire regimes and rabbits may have contributed to the decline in some areas (Woinarski et al. 2014).

254614193,11633,Leporillus apicalis,Extinct,,2024,2024-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last two specimens were collected by Norman Tindale, near Mt Crombie, south of the Musgrave Ranges in northwestern South Australia in July 1933. Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the stick-nest rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there is little doubt that the species is Extinct.","Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). There are also historic records of it sheltering in tree hollows (Robinson 2023).The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs, seeds and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999, McDowell et al. 2012). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of  the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat Leporillus conditor are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm. 2011).The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. The species was social, with nests sheltering several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest (Robinson 2023).Radiocarbon dates of stick-nest rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson et al. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson et al. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.","Predation by feral cats Felis catus is likely to have been the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonised the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes in its range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of Leporillus has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20th century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge et al. 1988). The decline happened from east to west and from south to north (Copley 1999). It is now extinct.The date this species was last seen in the wild may have been as late as the 1970s, as a large rodent that was captured and released in 1970 in a cave west of the Canning Stock Route, Western Australia, may have been this species (Robinson and Burbidge 2008). Information from the aboriginal population suggest this species persisted up to about 1950 (Robinson 2023).","","Collation of available records from a variety of sources (Copley 1999), including the remains of stick nests and subfossil data (e.g., Watts and Eves 1976, Baynes and Johnson 1996, summarised in Copley 1999 and Burbidge et al. 2009) shows that the Lesser Stick-nest Rat formerly ranged though semi-arid and arid Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and the far northwest of Victoria, although the distribution was probably patchy and dependent on there being suitable vegetation for food.The distribution of stick-nest rats formed arcs along the southeastern, southern and southwestern boundaries of the arid zone, from western Victoria to North West Cape in Western Australia.  The Lesser Stick-nest Rat occurred further inland from the arid zone boundary, reaching the MacDonnell Ranges and Uluru (Baynes and Baird 1992) and occurring in the Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts, but also extended further southwest, to Peak Charles and probably parts of the Western Australian wheatbelt (A.

All concluded that this species is extinct with &gt;90% probability. The estimated extinction date was 1963 (Fisher and Blomberg 2012).","John Gilbert, who collected specimens for John Gould in the 1830s, noted that the Crescent Nail-tailed Wallaby was ‘found in the gum forests of the interior of Western Australia, where there are patches of thick scrub and dense thickets, in the open glades intervening between which it is occasionally seen sunning itself, but at the slightest alarm immediately takes itself to the shelter of the thick scrub’ (Gould 1863). (Gilbert’s ‘forests’ would today be termed woodlands.) John Gilbert reported to Gould (1863) that ‘it makes no nest, but forms a hollow in the soft ground beneath a thick brush in which it lies during the heat of the day’. Bruce Leake, an early settler of Kellerberrin, reported that it inhabited open timbered country and that when chased would make for a tree with a hollow in the bottom and clamber up the sides until it got some distance up into the tree (Leake 1962). Aboriginal people from the western deserts recalled that it inhabited most types of country, including stony hills, and was particularly abundant in mulga (Acacia aneura) country. They said it ate grass and sheltered lying on its side under a low shady tree or shrub (Burbidge et al. 1988). Aboriginal people from the Flinders Ranges of South Australia recalled that it lived throughout the ranges and on the adjacent plains (Tunbridge 1991).","This species was probably extirpated by predation from introduced Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes and feral Cats Felis catus. Cats were widespread in the species’ range by the 1890s (Abbott 2008a). There is abundant evidence that feral Cats have a significant effect on medium-sized Australian mammals, including causing extinction (Dickman 1996). The Red Fox arrived in the south-west of Western Australia in the 1920s (Abbott 2008b). Habitat degradation, including changing fire regimes and the impact of rabbits and introduced stock, may have had an impact, especially in combination with predation. In part of its former range (south-western Western Australia and parts of New South Wales), pastoral expansion leading to habitat degradation, mainly by sheep, was likely to have been detrimental to the species. There is some evidence for epizootic disease as a contributing factor, possibly interacting with drought and predation (Abbott 2006).There is evidence for epizootic disease as a contributing factor to extinction of many mammal species in Western Australia. Many of these species declined before the arrival of foxes; however, this epizootic did not greatly affect arid zone mammals (Abbott 2006). Cats were widespread in the species’ range by the 1890s (Abbott 2002b, 2008). There is abundant evidence that feral Cats have a significant effect on medium-sized Australian mammals, including causing extinction (Dickman 1996).

Small areas of slightly higher ground carried sparse stands of Drooping She-oak Allocasuarina verticillata, which were used for shelter. Toolache Wallabies had an unusual gait in which the length of bounds was irregular, but were capable of high speed for long periods (Robinson and Young 1983).",Habitat loss and fragmentation was catastrophic as the whole original range is now agricultural land (Robinson and Young 1983). The introduced Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and hunting contributed to the extinction (Robinson and Young 1983).,"The Toolache Wallaby is extinct. It was common within a restricted range.

By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed, and led to the death of some of the few remaining individuals.

Despite numerous reports of sightings since then including on mainland Australia (Heberle 2004), and many organised searches in Tasmania by government agencies, conservation NGOs, philanthropists, and others (more search effort than any other extinct mammal (Fisher and Blomberg 2011)), there has been no convincing evidence of its persistence. Brook et al. (2023) used uncertainty modelling of purported sightings to map a regional extirpation pattern, and concluded that it probably persisted until the 1980s, however Mooney (2023) concluded that no sightings since 1936 can be substantiated. All data sets analysed with a conservative probabilistic sighting-record resampling by Brook et al. (2023) concluded that the Thylacine has 100% probability of being extinct in 2023. The statistical approaches of Brook et al. (2023), Carlson et al. (2018) and Fisher &amp; Blomberg (2011, 2012) are robust probabilistic extinction models using sighting data that included uncertainty of records, distribution variables, search effort, and other trait data. There have been at least six classes of quantitative models applied to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of the thylacine in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Fisher and Humphries 2024). 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow 1993), 2) Weibull model / Optimal linear estimation (Roberts and Solow 2003), 3) Nonparametric (Solow and Smith 2005), 4) Cox Regression Survival model of threat and effort (Fisher and Blomberg 2012), 5) Bayesian Stationary Poisson model with varying certainty of sightings and independent processes for valid and invalid sightings (Solow and Beet 2014, Carlson et al. 2018), 6) Stationary Poisson with resampling (Brook et al. 2019, Brook et al. 2023). These have used a range of assumptions about the data distribution and certainty, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and sets of different sources of data including sighting dates, species traits, measures of effort, distributional data, and observer reliability. Virtually all have concluded that the Thylacine is extinct, and nearly all (and all with physical evidence) have concluded that the extinction date was in the 1930s or 1940s. Additionally, from 2014 to 2020, 3,225 camera trap sites throughout Tasmania leading to photographs on &gt;315,000 camera nights revealed no detections of anything that could be attributed to a Thylacine (C.N. Johnson pers. comm.).","Thylacines occurred in most habitats in Tasmania, but apparently not the dense temperate rainforests of the south-west (Paddle 2000). The skull of the Thylacine is highly convergent with the wolf suggesting similar dietary ecology (Newton 2021), although it probably had a less powerful bite than a wolf (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). It was likely an endurance runner ('coursing predator') that hunted and scavenged mainly at night, singly or in pairs. Before it was widely persecuted, diurnal observations were also reported (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its main food items were reported to be kangaroos and wallabies. Dens were often located among rocks and in caves, Paddle (1993) describes a 1903 photograph of a den in a shallow cave containing nesting material of ferns. Litters (of up to four young, usually two or three) were also discovered amongst dense vegetation.","There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of a perceived threat to sheep, and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). From 1830 (less than three decades after Europeans arrived in Tasmania), companies and individual landowners began offering bounty payments (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its eradication was funded by a Tasmanian government scheme from 1888 to 1909, and a bounty was paid for more than 2,200 Thylacines killed (Heberle et al. 2004, Sleightholme and Campbell 2016). This is a similar number to the estimated Thylacine population of Tasmania at any one time (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Collecting by museums and zoos was also a major reason for hunting in the early 20th century. A disease similar to canine distemper could have contributed to extinction (Paddle 2012). However single-species population viability analysis models are unable to account for extinction unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate is assumed, even if disease effects are included from 1906 to 1909. Thylacine extinction in Tasmania is readily recreated using disease-free multi-species models that simulate declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse et al. 2013).",This species is presumed to be extinct.,"","The Thylacine was once found on the island of New Guinea and was widespread on the Australian mainland, but disappeared from everywhere except Tasmania by at least 2000 years ago, probably because of predation by and competition from the Dingo Canis lupus (Johnson 2006). In modern times it was known only in Tasmania, which was isolated from the Australian mainland c. 8,000 – 10,000 years ago, before the arrival of the Dingo on the mainland. It was widespread in Tasmania, but most abundant in open forest and woodland (Guiler 1985, Paddle 2000). It occurred in most habitat types from low (east) to high (north-west) rainfall but at low densities in the south-west where rainfall is very high, soil fertility is very low, and vegetation is hummock grassland (button grass), wet scrub, or wet forest.","",Terrestrial,"In 1936, the Thylacine received legal protection under Tasmanian law (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). In 1966, a 647,000 ha game reserve was set up in south-western Tasmania, partly to protect any animals possibly remaining in the area. Currently there are no conservation measures pertaining to this species as it is presumed extinct. It is listed on CITES Appendix I.

Four types of probabilistic models to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of this species have been published (Fisher and Humphries 2024): a 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow 1993), a Weibull model (Roberts and Solow 2003), a Nonparametric model (Solow and Smith 2005), and Threat &amp; effort Cox Regression Survival model (Fisher and Blomberg 2012).

The estimated extinction date was 1898 (Fisher and Blomberg, 2012).","Krefft (1866) reported it from 'level country' in semi-arid country, and that it was solitary. It was strictly nocturnal and slept during the day under bushes or other shelter. He also reported it to be the fleetest wallaby, and capable of leaping 'more than 8 feet high'.Krefft (1866) noted that it 'is easily tamed'; and that it had a single young at a time.","The extinction of the Eastern Hare-wallaby may be attributable to several factors and their interactions. These include predation by the introduced domestic Cat Felis catus and Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, competition with the introduced Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, habitat degradation due to over-stocking with sheep and cattle, and changed fire regimes associated with removal of Indigenous land management (Dickman 1996, Short 1998, Menkhorst 2009, Strahan and Eldridge 2023).","Little is known about this species. Krefft (1866) found it to be common in the 1850s on the plains around the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers, and as evidence of this abundance, collected 41 specimens (Menkhorst 2009). It rapidly declined to extinction within 30-40 years.","","The Eastern Hare-wallaby formerly occurred in central New South Wales, north-western Victoria and eastern South Australia. Subfossil data extends the range into southern Queensland (Burbidge et al. 2009).

Over-hunting and severe deforestation appear to be the primary drivers of its extinction.","Historical reports suggest the species had high forest dependence, however it was hunted due to the damage it did to crops, so clearly occasionally ventured into more open areas, and apparently fed in coffee plantations (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014, Hume 2017). The species' morphology suggests it was an opportunistic forager that occupied all forest strata (Hume 2014). The species was likely omnivorous, as are most starlings, and nested in tree cavities (Hume 2017). Historical observations also suggest the species was a vertical migrant, breeding in mountain forests during summer (Hume 2014).","The primary causes of the species' extinction were undoubtedly deforestation and hunting. Historical reports suggest that the species primarily occupied the interior of forests (Hume 2017). As deforestation accelerated through the 1830s (Hume 2017), this would have caused the rapid decline of the species' habitat. The species did however move into coffee plantations where it would feed on insects that plagued the coffee flowers (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014), but as plantations gave way to sugarcane during the 1830s, even this marginal habitat was lost (Hume 2017). As the species was also considered a pest, it was heavily hunted during the 1800s (Hume 2017). Supposedly, the species was easily approached, and hunters could take dozens at a time as a consequence (Cheke 1987, Hume 2017). There are also suggestions that disease contacted from introduced Acroditheres tristris (Common Mynas) and impacts from introduced cats and rats may also have caused declines, but as mynas occurred on the island as early as 1759 (Cheke and Hume 2008), and the species survived for decades alongside cats and rats, any declines from these threats are likely negligible (Hume 2017).",No extant population remains.,"",Fregilupus varius was endemic to Réunion (to France).,The species was heavily persecuted for the damage it did to crops (Hume 2017).,Terrestrial,"",Afrotropical,1859,false,false,Global
