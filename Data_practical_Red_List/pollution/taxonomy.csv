Vanvoorstia spectabilis and V. coccinea are common tropical (Indo-Pacific, including GBR) species, with the former also recorded from Lord Howe Island. While some confusion exists as to the exact differences between these two species (Price and Scott 1992), both are easily distinguished and considered very different from V. bennettiana, a very much smaller- and finer-meshed species in which the tetrasporangial stichidia are also easily defined. There are now four species. Eric Coppejans (pers. comm.) indicates that there is a new species he described from East Africa which is probably Critically Endangered: Vanvoorstia incipiens De Clerck, Wynne &amp; Coppejans (Phycologia 38 (1999): 394-400). This newly described species occurs massively in a single (rather small) bay along the east coast of Zanzibar, at about low tide level (large amounts drifting or entangled to other seaweeds in intertidal pools). Coppejans carried out over 200 collecting excursions along the Kenyan, Tanzanian (incl. Zanzibar) coast and NEVER found a single specimen anywhere else than the type locality, where we find it again year after year. It doesn't occur in the neighbouring bays, which look ""identical"" to this one! If that bay would be disturbed (harbour, oil pollution, etc.) the only known (type) locality would disappear and we would have a similar story there within the same genus!! Apparently some representatives do not succeed in colonizing larger areas!"

This concept of the taxon continues to be referred to as the ""North Sea Houting"" in published literature, with a single extant indigenous subpopulation understood to inhabit the Vidå River in Denmark.However, comparative morphological evidence suggests that it is an extinct potamodromous species formerly restricted to the southern North Sea basin. Under this concept, anadromous subpopulations from northern Germany and Denmark together correspond to the congeneric Maraena Whitefish (Coregonus maraena), which also occurs in the Baltic Sea basin (Freyhof and Schöter 2005).Subsequent molecular analyses have concluded that the Vidå River subpopulation is genetically distinct from those located further north, but failed to rule out that extinct subpopulations from the southern North Sea represented a distinct taxon (Hansen et al. 2008, Jacobsen et al. 2012). Moreover, the Vidå River subpopulation does not appear to be conspecific with these former subpopulations (Mehner et al. 2018).In the absence of a general consensus, the IUCN Red List currently follows the nomenclature provided by Fricke et al.

They are typified by parallel patterns of divergence in traits associated with foraging (i.e., gill raker counts, benthic vs. pelagic feeding ecology), physiology (i.e., growth rate, habitat depth partitioning) and reproductive ecology (i.e., reproductive timing and spawning habitat).Up to six different sympatric forms sometimes referred to as “morphs”, ""ecomorphs"" or ""ecotypes"" have been recorded in perialpine lakes, and these radiations might be even more diverse in some large systems of northeastern Europe (Præbel et al. 2013, Doenz et al. 2018, Bitz‐Thorsen et al. 2020, Öhlund et al. 2020).However, there exist significant differences in opinion regarding the taxonomic status of these forms.In Northern Europe, including the United Kingdom, all except a handful of Irish subpopulations are usually regarded as belonging to two widely distributed species; Coregonus albula (ciscoes) and C. lavaretus (whitefishes), with the latter also frequently referred to as the ""Coregonus lavaretus species complex” (Etheridge et al. 2012, Wanke et al. 2017, Häkli et al. 2018, Crotti et al. 2020). Within this comparatively uniform taxonomic concept, the catch-all English vernacular name “Vendace” is typically used for C. albula while ""Common Whitefish"" or ""European Whitefish"" are applied to C. lavaretus.Conversely, researchers and fisheries authorities based in Central Europe have tended to treat the different forms as distinct taxa, leading to the recognition of more than 60 species across the European region (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007, Selz et al. 2020, De-Kayne et al. 2022, Selz and Seehausen 2023). Under this diverse taxonomic concept, the name “Vendace” is restricted to its original usage for the United Kingdom endemic Coregonus vandesius and the native range of C. lavaretus is limited to its type locality of Lake Bourget in France.With the above in mind, it appears unlikely that the striking phenotypic diversity exhibited by members of this genus will ever be adequately represented by a single accepted taxonomic system.

They are typified by parallel patterns of divergence in traits associated with foraging (i.e., gill raker counts, benthic vs. pelagic feeding ecology), physiology (i.e., growth rate, habitat depth partitioning) and reproductive ecology (i.e., reproductive timing and spawning habitat).Up to six different sympatric forms sometimes referred to as “morphs”, ""ecomorphs"" or ""ecotypes"" have been recorded in perialpine lakes, and these radiations might be even more diverse in some large systems of northeastern Europe (Præbel et al. 2013, Doenz et al. 2018, Bitz‐Thorsen et al. 2020, Öhlund et al. 2020).However, there exist significant differences in opinion regarding the taxonomic status of these forms.In Northern Europe, including the United Kingdom, all except a handful of Irish subpopulations are usually regarded as belonging to two widely-distributed species; Coregonus albula (ciscoes) and C. lavaretus (whitefishes), with the latter also frequently referred to as the ""Coregonus lavaretus species complex” (Etheridge et al. 2012, Wanke et al. 2017, Häkli et al. 2018, Crotti et al. 2020). Within this comparatively uniform taxonomic concept, the catch-all English vernacular name “Vendace” is typically used for C. albula while ""Common Whitefish"" or ""European Whitefish"" are applied to C. lavaretus.Conversely, researchers and fisheries authorities based in Central Europe have tended to treat the different forms as distinct taxa, leading to the recognition of more than 60 species across the European region (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007, Selz et al. 2020, De-Kayne et al. 2022, Selz and Seehausen 2023). Under this diverse taxonomic concept, the name “Vendace” is restricted to its original usage for the United Kingdom endemic Coregonus vandesius and the native range of C. lavaretus is limited to its type locality of Lake Bourget in France.With the above in mind, it appears unlikely that the striking phenotypic diversity exhibited by members of this genus will ever be adequately represented by a single accepted taxonomic system.

When such divergence occurs within a single lake system, the different sympatric forms are often referred to as “morphs”, “morphotypes”, ""ecomorphs"" or ""ecotypes"" (Snorrason et al. 1994, Adams et al. 1998, Knudsen et al. 2006, Klemetsen 2010, Muir et al. 2016).Some of these subpopulations and sympatric forms have over time been described as nominal species, including at least 15 from North America, around 30 from Europe and 12 from Siberia and the Far East. However, these taxa encompass only a small fraction of charr distribution and diversity, and there exist significant differences in opinion regarding which of them should be considered valid (Savvaitova 1995, Adams and Maitland 2007, Kottelat and Freyhof 2007, Klemetsen 2010, Whiteley et al. 2019).With the above in mind, there is an emerging consensus that the striking genetic and phenotypic diversity exhibited by members of this genus cannot be adequately represented by a single accepted taxonomic system (Whiteley et al. 2019).The Red List currently follows the nomenclature provided by Fricke et al.
