Papenf.,"The genus <i>Vanvoorstia</i> contains three species. <i>Vanvoorstia spectabilis</i> and <i>V. coccinea</i> are common tropical (Indo-Pacific, including GBR) species, with the former also recorded from Lord Howe Island. While some confusion exists as to the exact differences between these two species (Price and Scott 1992), both are easily distinguished and considered very different from <i>V. bennettiana</i>, a very much smaller- and finer-meshed species in which the tetrasporangial stichidia are also easily defined.
<br>
<br>There are now four species. Eric Coppejans (pers. comm.) indicates that there is  a new species he described from East Africa which is probably Critically Endangered: <i>Vanvoorstia incipiens</i> De Clerck, Wynne & Coppejans (<i>Phycologia</i> 38 (1999): 394-400). This newly described species  occurs massively in a single (rather small) bay along the east coast of Zanzibar, at about low tide level (large amounts drifting or entangled to other seaweeds in intertidal pools). Coppejans carried out over 200 collecting excursions along the Kenyan, Tanzanian (incl. Zanzibar) coast and NEVER found a single specimen anywhere else than the type locality, where we find it again year after year. It doesn't occur in the neighbouring bays, which look ""identical"" to this one! If that bay would be disturbed (harbour, oil pollution, etc.) the only known (type) locality  would disappear and we would have a similar story there within the same genus!! Apparently some representatives do not succeed in colonizing larger areas!"

""Albock"" or <em>C.</em> sp. ""Albeli-Albock"" in some published literature.<br/><br/>At the regional scale, the systematics of European ciscoes and whitefishes (<em>Coregonus</em> spp.) has been the subject of considerable debate since the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, with little indication of a definitive outcome.<br/><br/>It  is widely accepted that non-anadromous members of this group have  repeatedly undergone adaptive radiations in boreal, subarctic and  perialpine lakes (Douglas<em> et al.</em> 1999, Østbye <em>et al.</em> 2005, Kahilainen and Østbye 2006, Harrod <em>et al.</em> 2010, Hudson <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Subpopulations  inhabiting these systems largely diversified in the wake of the most  recent glacial period 10,000-15,000 years ago. They are typified by  parallel patterns of divergence in traits associated with foraging  (i.e., gill raker counts, benthic vs. pelagic feeding ecology),  physiology (i.e., growth rate, habitat depth partitioning) and  reproductive ecology (i.e., reproductive timing and spawning habitat).<br/><br/>Up  to six different sympatric forms sometimes referred to as “morphs”,  ""ecomorphs"" or ""ecotypes"" have been recorded in perialpine lakes, and  these radiations might be even more diverse in some large systems of  northeastern Europe (Præbel <em>et al.</em> 2013, Doenz <em>et al.</em> 2018, Bitz‐Thorsen <em>et al.</em> 2020, Öhlund <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>However, there exist significant differences in opinion regarding the taxonomic status of these forms.<br/><br/>In  Northern Europe, including the United Kingdom, all except a handful of  Irish subpopulations are usually regarded as belonging to two  widely-distributed species; <em>Coregonus albula</em> (ciscoes) and <em>C. lavaretus</em> (whitefishes), with the latter also frequently referred to as the ""<em>Coregonus lavaretus</em> species complex” (Etheridge <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wanke <em>et al. </em>2017, Häkli <em>et al. </em>2018, Crotti <em>et al.</em>  2020). Within this comparatively uniform taxonomic concept, the  catch-all English vernacular name “Vendace” is typically used for <em>C. albula</em> while ""Common Whitefish"" or ""European Whitefish"" are applied to <em>C. lavaretus</em>.<br/><br/>Conversely,  researchers and fisheries authorities based in Central Europe have  tended to treat the different forms as distinct taxa, leading to the  recognition of more than 60 species across the European region (Kottelat  and Freyhof 2007, Selz <em>et al.</em> 2020, De-Kayne <em>et al.</em> 2022,  Selz and Seehausen 2023). Under this diverse taxonomic concept, the  name “Vendace” is restricted to its original usage for the United  Kingdom endemic <em>Coregonus vandesius</em> and the native range of <em>C. lavaretus</em> is limited to its type locality of Lake Bourget in France.<br/><br/>With the above in mind, it appears unlikely that the striking phenotypic diversity exhibited by members of this genus will ever be adequately represented by a single accepted taxonomic system. In the absence of a region-wide consensus, the IUCN Red List broadly follows the taxonomy provided by Fricke <em>et al.</em> (2024)."
