The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. <em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a <em>Nasturtium</em>-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, <em>Moxostoma mascotae</em> (now: <em>Moxostoma austrinum</em>), a Goodeid, <em>Allodontichthys</em> n. sp. (now: <em>Allodontichthys polylepis</em>) and a Poeciliid, <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>. <em>Rana</em> sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). <br/><br/>Schindler reported to Hieronimus  (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) occurred<em>,</em>&#160;which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>decreased in <em></em>abundance.<em> </em>The Swordtail<em> </em>is thought to have displaced&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei</em>&#160;through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989). <em><br/></em>","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus<em> et al.</em> in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus <em>et al. </em>2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000&#160;<em>Alloctoca goslinei</em>&#160;was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found.

These are the only botanists to have provided any details as to the species likely habitat preferences. However, W.R.

Irrespective, the lowland and slope forests of Rarotonga, and especially those in the vicinity of Avarua and Arorangi are amongst the most heavily modified on the island as a result of deforestation for agriculture, roading, housing and plantation forestry.

The river has been degraded due to the construction of the La Vega Dam and it is suggested that habitat degradation may have been the cause of the extant endemic Goodeids now being confined to a small area at the headwaters of the river.

13483086,2864,Bolyeria multocarinata,Extinct,,2021,2020-01-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has not been recorded since 1975 despite active conservation efforts on Round Island. Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.&#160; It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).<br/><br/>An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink <em>Leiolopisma telfairii</em>.","By 1881, the bolyerid snakes were restricted to Round Island, with rats having invaded Gunner’s Quoin (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and Flat Island (<em>R. rattus</em>) (Cheke and Hume 2008). By the 1900s, the burrowing boa was extremely rare on Round Island with single encounters in 1935, 1953 and 1967, despite repeated searches between the latter two dates (Vinson 1975). The fourth and last individual was detected in August 1975 (Bullock 1977). The removal of goats (<em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em>) in 1979 and rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) in 1986 (Merton 1987), followed by the recovery and restoration of the island’s habitat occurred too late for the burrowing boa: despite extensive searches and a full time presence of conservation staff on Round Island since 2002, the snake has not been detected (Cole<em> et al.</em> 2018) and is considered to be extinct.",,"The Round Island Burrowing Boa was a Mauritian endemic known from Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>).&#160;The burrowing boa was thought to have occurred on mainland Mauritius, but it is uncertain whether sub-fossil vertebrae belong to this burrowing boa or the extant Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>(Arnold 1980). If the former, the species is likely to have become locally extinct on this island in the mid-1800s due to the invasion of introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and<em> R. rattus</em>). Snakes of the size of the Round Island Burrowing Boa and Keel-scaled Boa were recorded on the offshore islets Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km2) and Flat Island (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>) in the north until at least 1839 and Ile de la Passe (0.02 km2) in the southeast in the 1760s (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008).

Its closest sister species, <em>Gongylomorphus bojerii</em> from Mauritius, is diurnal and inhabits most habitats on the island (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009), including lowland forest, grassland, sparsely vegetated areas with creepers as ground cover, and bare rock with crevices and rock piles (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2020). The Réunion species was probably found in dry forest in the west of the island and in coastal vegetation (Probst 1998). It was probably primarily insectivorous in common with its extant relatives (Probst 1998)","This species is extinct, and the most likely cause of its extinction is the introduction of the Southeast Asian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), a specialist feeder on lizards, to Réunion in the mid-19th century (Austin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). The documented timing of this snake's establishment on both Réunion (by 1840, based on testimony taken in 1839 - Cheke 1987) and mainland Mauritius (before 1873 - Daruty de Grandpré 1883) coincides with the extinction of <em>Gongylomorphus </em>skinks on both islands.&#160;Musk Shews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), have been observed preying on Mauritian <em>Gongylomorphus</em>&#160;(Cole 2011), and this invasive species probably contributed to the historical decline (M.

Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin <em>et al. </em>2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al. </em>2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax megacephalus</em>) and Rodrigues Owl (<em>Mascarenotus murivorus</em>)&#160;(Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).","This species is extinct. Only seven preserved specimens are known, six of which are in museums (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2014), in addition to numerous sub-fossil bones from approximately 100 individuals (Austin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species survived for longer than other endemic lizards on Rodrigues, none of which are extant. Until 1795, it was still abundant on the main island and was probably found on several of the 21 offshore islets, but the only islet from which it was confirmed as being present is Ile aux Fous (0.33 ha), where it was recorded in great numbers by Pingré in 1761 (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the late 1700s, Philibert Marragon observed that fewer geckos were encountered in winter compared to summer (Vinson and Vinson 1969). In 1874, they could not be found on the mainland and two specimens collected in 1884 were thought to have been from one of the islets (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The last two geckos - collected by Etienne Thirioux in 1917 - were also thought to have been from an islet (Vinson and Vinson 1969).

In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to  the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not  noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn  and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again  in early spring, presumably returning to the sea.

The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of  factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration  of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover  resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature  and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species&#160;was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. Hector (1871) reported of immense and conspicuous shoals ascending the Hutt River (southern North Island) in January. Apparently, however, signs of decreasing numbers were evident soon afterwards. The disappearance of the fish from the Waikato River (North Island) was noted to have occurred in 1874. In 1878, Rutland (who studied the species in the Nelson and Marlborough district, South Island), noted that in the Maitai River (n the north of the South Island) it had 'become very scarce during the past three years'. This disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. There are reports of this species being caught in the 1920s and in the early 1930s a specimen (possibly the last), was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010, Best 1929, Radway-Allen 1949).",Unknown,"The New Zealand Grayling (<em>Prototroctes oxyrhynchus</em>) was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori prior to European settlement and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing.

21425735,11073,Labidura herculeana,Extinct,,2014,2014-08-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This is the world’s largest known earwig, attaining a length of up to 80 mm. A total of 40 specimens were collected from the Horse Point area during the two Belgian expeditions from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1965-6 and 1967 (Brindle 1970). Live specimens were not found at any other sites at this time although they reported fragments of dead individuals from the south and east flanks of Flagstaff. There are a couple of unconfirmed records that the species was present after this time and it was thought to be declining. Two expeditions were conducted by Paul Pearce-Kelly from the London Zoo in 1988 and 1993, however, they failed to find any trace of the species. Recent intensive survey work in the 1990s and 2000s by Philip and Myrtle Ashmole failed to locate the species in this or nearby areas (Ashmole and Ashmole 2003). Howard Mendel from the Natural History Museum in London also failed to find it during a visit with the Ashmoles in 2005-6. The habitat at Horse Point has been degraded as far as this species is concerned since the time of the Belgian expeditions by the removal of nearly all surface stones, under which specimens were then found, for construction purposes. There has also been potential increased predator pressure from mice and rats, and probably also from invasive non-native predatory invertebrates including spiders and the centipede <em>Scolopendra morsitans</em>&#160;Linnaeus, 1758. The only possible evidence that this species may have persisted beyond the time of the Belgian expeditions has been the discovery of fragments of dead individuals. A sub-fossil forcep and ninth abdominal tergite was found with bird bones in 1995 near Prosperous Bay. Two further ninth abdominal tergites have been recovered since. The first was found under a discarded piece of equipment in the centre of Horse Point Plain in 2013; the second in a small area at the Millennium Forest in 2014 where some remaining surface rock is present. However, this second fragment was found in a concentration of invertebrate remains in the lair of a predatory spider. As all of these remains are fragmentary and the insect itself relatively robust with remains persisting potentially for many decades it has to be assumed that these specimens had been dead for a considerable time. The species is large, charismatic and of iconic status on the island; while there is still a slim possibility that it may still persist in some remote location, the balance of evidence points towards the species being extinct. The last confirmed adult sighting was in May 1967.","The species is xerophilus and nocturnal. At Horse Point the species was mostly found in burrows beneath stones with the adults appearing during the summer rains (December to February), seeking shelter again at the onset of drier weather (Brindle 1970). The burrows extended for a considerable distance and eventually become lost in fissures in the soil. When disturbed the adults tried to escape by running into these burrows. Mating was observed twice on 22/12/1965 and 1/2/1967 and a females with eggs were observed on 8/3/1967 and 24/3/1967. It is possible that in the past the species also inhabited bird colonies as indicated by its presence as a sub-fossil with bird bones.","<p>There has been a general decline in habitat quality and an increase in the number of invasive non-native predators including rats, mice, spiders and the centipede <em>Scolopendra morsitans</em>&#160;Linnaeus, 1758.

The last subpopulation of this species <em>in situ</em> was&#160;extirpated around 2015, confirmed by&#160;exhaustive surveys,&#160;and the&#160;New Zealand Threat Classification System assessed this species as ‘Threatened / Nationally Critical’ Qualified ‘Conservation Dependent' and ‘Extinct in the Wild' (de Lange&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). The species is here assessed as Extinct in the Wild.","The ecology of<em> Clianthus puniceus</em> is unknown, though it was likely to have been like that reported for <em>Clianthus magnificus</em> by Shaw and Burns (1997) (as <em>Clianthus puniceus</em>) which is typically found in early to mid-successional shrubland habitats often dominated by harakeke (<em>Phormium tenax</em>), wharariki (<em>Phormium cookianum</em>&#160;= <em>P. colensoi;&#160;</em>POWO 2023) and tutu (<em>Coriaria arborea</em> var. <em>arborea</em>) in coastal and lowland habitats. On Moturemu Island plants grew at the base of an unstable cliff face in colluvium in low windshorn coastal shrubland. As with <em>Clianthus magnificus</em> the exact ecology of <em>Clianthus puniceus </em>is muddied by the fact it was planted widely by Māori, and it is possible that some sites stem from past plantings (de Lange <em>et al.</em> 2010, de Lange 2023).<span style=""""></span>","<em>Clianthus puniceus </em>was already a scarce plant by the time resident botanists started exploring the flora of Aotearoa / New Zealand. Few genuinely wild occurrences were reported between the 1830's and 1960's and it is possible that all the sites noted in literature stem from Māori plantings. The reason for this species' scarcity is not clear but irrespective, it has the same vulnerabilities known from <em>Clianthus magnificus</em> i.e., susceptibility to browsing animals such as feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>), red deer (<em>Cervus elaphus</em>) and possums (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>). At Moturemu Island plants were reported in the 1960's and 1970's then again in the late 1980's and early 1990's. At this site it was surmised that plants were growing in suboptimal conditions – on the assumption at that time that the ecology of <em>Clianthus magnificus</em> and <em>Clianthus puniceus</em> (then treated as one species) were the same (Shaw and Burns 1997). This led to seedlings being removed from the island and grown on in ‘safe sites’ on Tiritirimatangi Island and the Auckland Botanic Gardens. The Moturemu Island plants were noted to be short-lived, succumbing to drought, rat browsing (despite rat control) and being outcompeted by taller woody invasive plants. The loss of the Moturemu Island population was probably hastened by the inaccessibility of the location which prevented regular monitoring.","There are no wild plants / subpopulations known of this species. The species is now regarded as ‘Extinct in the Wild’, the last known wild subpopulation (Moturemu Island, Kaipara Harbour) died out about 2015 (de Lange&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).",,"This species is endemic to Aotearoa / New Zealand, where it occurred on Te Ika a Maui / North Island. As circumscribed by Heenan (2000) it was known only from Auckland and Northland. There are no extant subpopulations, the last wild one, found on Moturemu Island, Kaipara Harbour was extirpated <em>c.</em> 2015. Few herbarium specimens from supposed wild subpopulations are known but it seems that the species was once present on islands in the Bay of Islands, on Limestone Island, Whangarei and from Motukaraka / Flat Island near Auckland. Many literature records are not supported with herbarium specimens leaving it unclear if&#160;<em>Clianthus puniceus&#160;</em>or&#160;<em>C. magnificus&#160;</em>was present, or indeed if the records were from garden plants or genuinely wild occurrences.","This species is occasionally cultivated both in Aotearoa / New Zealand and internationally. Most plants sold by nurseries are <em>Clianthus magnificus</em>, usually marketed as <em>C. puniceus</em> ‘Kaka King’ or <em>C. maximus</em> ‘Kaka King’. A white-flowered race is also known. When <em>Clianthus magnificus</em> became commercially available it rapidly supplanted <em>C. puniceus</em> as the latest ‘fad’ plant, and now genuine <em>C. puniceus</em> is rarely seen in cultivation or for sale.",Terrestrial,"<em>Clianthus puniceus </em>is a taonga (treasure) to Auckland and Northland iwi. As such, some iwi have nurseries growing the species and there have been attempted plantings on Motuarohia (Bay of Islands), Limestone Island (Whangarei Harbour), Tiritirimatangi and Motuihe islands (Hauraki Gulf). Plantings have also been made on restoration land managed by the New Zealand Forest Restoration Trust along the south-western shore of the Kaipara Harbour. All these plantings have used Moturemu Island plants and so represent one lineage only. It has been suggested that efforts are made to secure seed from cultivated <em>C. puniceus</em> worldwide on the assumption that these may add to the existing genetic diversity because they may represent provenances that have died out in Aotearoa / New Zealand.&#160;<br/><br/>Despite plantings, without regular weeding and control of browsing animals, including introduced slugs and snails, plants are rarely persistent. Natural recruitment from plantings has yet to be observed. As with <em>Clianthus magnificus,&#160;</em>hand clearing of competing weeds and spraying of plants for insect pests and diseases, as well as using sprays to deter browsing animals could be used to maintain and enhance plantings.<br/><br/>New Zealand Threat Classification System assessed this species as ‘Threatened / Nationally Critical’ Qualified ‘CD’ [Conservation Dependent], ‘EW’ [Extinct in the Wild] (de Lange <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Australasian,2015,false,false,Global

March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J.

Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.<br/><br/>This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved<em> </em>as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.<br/><br/>Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months.

At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: <em>Opogona</em> sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.</p>","<p>Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.<br/><br/>Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.<br/><br/>The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.</p>","<p>From the 20<sup>th</sup> Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known.&#160;In the 1950s&#160;Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.<br/><br/>A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.</p>",,"The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island.&#160;This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"<p>Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.<br/><br/>The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.<br/><br/>Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant. Here a thriving population has been created amongst mixed stands of endemics, with a graded-age structure. In this favourable habitat, plants naturally self-seed to a moderate degree despite patchy levels of viability, although none of the progeny has yet reached maturity (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).</p>",Afrotropical,2012,false,false,Global

Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","<p>The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum </em><span class=""authorship"">(Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived&#160; of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.<br/><br/>Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood<em> </em>once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (<em>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</em> Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.</p>","Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.",,"The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.<br/><br/>Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between <em>T. erythroxylon</em> and the related Dwarf Ebony (<em>Trochetiopsis ebenus</em> Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to <em>T. erythroxylon</em> parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.<br/><br/>A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and&#160;periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.</p>",Afrotropical,1950s,false,false,Global

Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln. The exceptionally dense, black wood was potentially very valuable, but it seems likely that many of the remaining trees were carelessly harvested for crude timber or firewood, and the bark stripped as a tanning agent.","The last confirmed record was made by Banks and Solander in 1771 (Banks 1896). Roxburgh reported that a few plants survived until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century (see Beatston 1816), though it seems likely that he did not see them personally.",,"The Ebony Tree was formerly known from dry lowland valleys and hill slopes of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. Very few botanical records were made before the 19<sup>th</sup> Century when the island had already been severely degraded by deforestation and grazing. We thus know little about the original flora, particularly those species which disappeared during the early phase of human impact. However, since the Ebony Tree was economically important it received occasional mentions in historical documents, and clues to its presence can still be found today in the form of fragments of semi-fossilized wood which still litter some of the drier seaward slopes.<br/><br/>From these indications, it appears that the species inhabited lowland areas of St Helena, especially along the south coast. Records have been made from Sandy Bay, Asses’ Ears, Devil’s Hole, Manati Bay, near Egg Island and Horse Pasture. Other possible locations include The Barn, High Knoll and Ebony Plain, but these are subject to potential confusion with the related Dwarf Ebony.",Fragments of ebony wood are still collected today.

As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em> (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (<em>Lachanodes arborea</em> (Roxb.) B.Nord.).<br/><br/>The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months.

Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.<br/><br/>Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests.

It was only recorded from pristine rainforest where there was no disturbance. Males would call in summer along the edge of creeks and streams. It was one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceeded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990).

The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species&#160;was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.<br/><br/>Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species <em>Taudactylus diurnus</em> (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines <em>et al.</em> 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.",,"This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines <em>et al</em>. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km<sup>2</sup> (map in Hines<em> et al</em>. 1999).

This species experienced very rapid declines, from being relatively common to extinct at each known locality within just a year or so, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This species was a rainforest specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001), and found in upland rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest along fast-flowing streams where there is white water from riffles and cascades (Liem 1974, McDonald 1992). It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/><br/>Richard <em>et al.</em> (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). However, this species had apparently disappeared from sites on the Atherton Tableland much earlier (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al. </em>1993, Trenerry <em>et al.</em> 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019).

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards <em>et al.</em> (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger<em> et al. </em>1999, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).<br/><br/>Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards<em> et al.</em> 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero <em>et al.</em> 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero <em>et al.</em> 2002, Schloegel <em>et al.</em> 2006).

It is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on the fruit of native understory plants (Maxfield 1998, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999)<strong></strong>. As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>and<em> </em>the native Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius </em>(classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) <strong></strong>and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> carried by feral cats (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2002, J.

The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in <em>C. hawaiiensis</em>, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow <em>C. brachyrhynchos</em> in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J.

The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).

About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders  (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J.

In particular, declines appear to have taken place in most native lizard species following the introduction of the Indian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) in the early 1980s (Andrew <em>et al. </em>2016), and Wolf Snake predation is now understood to be the proximate cause of this skink's extinction.

This is however not thought likely to be realistic for the Saint Lucia skink, a large lizard on a herpetologically very well-studied island from which another lizard species has been lost following the introduction of rats and mongoose (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2016).","This species was considered extinct as early as Barbour (1937). Four specimens are known, all in the British Museum, with an accession date of 1889 (Hedges and Conn 2012). This was a very large terrestrial lizard, but has never been found since despite a number of targeted surveys by herpetologists visiting the island, although there have been very few visits to the highest elevations.",,This species is known only from the island of Saint Lucia in the Lesser Antilles. No precise localities are known (Hedges and Conn 2012),"There is no use of or trade in this species, which is presumed to be extinct.",Terrestrial,"While this species is presumed to be extinct, workers should be vigilant for the possibility that an undetected population of this lizard still exists and the health of any remaining populations.

Within the last few years Redonda has been subject to intensive survey work as it is important for three surviving species of endemic lizards, however no evidence of a surviving population of <em>C. redondae </em>has been recorded.","No ecological information is available (Hedges and Conn 2012). Redonda's native habitat is likely to have been open dry forest (Bell and Daltry 2010, Morse 1979); much of this was cleared during guano mining activity - as Redonda is home to a large seabird colony - probably shortly after this skink was collected. Remaining native vegetation is almost entirely gone following invasion of the island by rats and goats, and there is no recruitment into surviving tree population. It would have been terrestrial, either on rocks or in leaf litter while this still existed.","It is likely that black rats preyed on this terrestrial lizard (Hedges and Conn 2012), and it may have been reliant to some degree on native vegetation, invertebrates and litter structure which has now been lost. Almost no vegetation remains on Redonda due to overgrazing by goats. Given this, the failure of multiple targeted surveys to record it, and the apparent sensitivity of skinks on Caribbean islands - many of which have drastically declined or been lost following mammal introductions - <em>Copeoglossum redondae</em> is presumed to be extinct.","This species was described on the basis of an adult female collected between 1863 and 1873.

118976576,54583,Anaxyrus baxteri,Extinct in the Wild,,2022,2020-06-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Extinct in the Wild because this species is believed to have become extinct following declines in the 1960s and 1970s. Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green <em>et al</em>. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of&#160;small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to <em>Bd</em>, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% <em>Bd</em> positive rates in tested toads (Polasik<em> et al.</em> 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter<em> et al</em>. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and&#160;reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002,&#160;2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).<strong><br/></strong>",,"This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km<sup>2</sup> of the Laramie Basin.

All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015).

(Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010). <em>Syzygium jambos</em> L. (Alston) locally known as roseapple, was originally brought to the island for fuel wood. However, because of its aggressive growth and the decline of it being harvested for fuel, the plants have become very large trees. Their branches spread laterally, forming a dense canopy and stopping native species from regenerating. Adding to this pressure, heavy soil erosion is also degrading this species’ habitat (Smyth 2008).</p>","This species has always been recorded as rare on Pitcairn Island.

Pitcairn is a small island, around 4 km in diameter, located in the South Central Pacific Ocean. Together with the islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno it forms part of the Pitcairn Island Group, a UK Overseas Territory. This species was initially collected on Pitcairn by Miss Rosalind Young in 1898 from Palver Valley Ridge but only described as a new species in 1981 by Fosberg. It was seen in the wild in 1955 by I.T. Twyford and collected by H. St. John in 1934. However, it was not found during the flora and vegetation survey of 1997, despite searches of known locations (Kingston 2001). It was re-discovered in 2003 at Tesdide by local islander Carol Warren. Cuttings and seeds were collected and propagated from this rediscovery and replanted at this location. In January 2005, a landslide on the island destroyed the original Tedside plant and three planted seedlings at this location. Despite efforts, this species has not been relocated in the wild ever since (Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010). It survives in conservation collections <em>ex situ</em>.</p>",There are no known uses for this species.,Terrestrial,"Protecting native plants and their habitats has been recognized as a priority for the Pitcairn Islands by its local government. In 2003 a nursery was established on the island. Native species have been propagated on the island, where a small <em>ex situ</em> collection of this species remains. Cuttings were also brought to National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin and Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and later to England to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew's Tropical Nursery. These plants have flowered and set seed. The 2010 seeds harvested from the National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin were banked at Glasnevin, at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank and also sent to the native species nursery on Pitcairn Island. Species recovery research has been partly funded by the Mohammed Bin Zayed Conservation Fund. Genetic studies were performed on several samples from wild and clone origin. It was proved that the degree of polymorphism in the population was reduced when the original plant and planted seedlings were destroyed in the 2005 landslide. The genetic variation of the <em>ex situ</em> collections is thought to be reduced with only one clone in existence comparing to the variation which might once have existed in the original populations.

Therefore, this species is assessed as Extinct in the Wild (EW).","This gregarious, thermophilic species inhabited a small (maximum recorded surface area c. 600 m<sup>2</sup>), shallow (maximum depth &lt; 2 metres) lake fed by a sublacustrine geothermal spring. Under natural conditions the mean annual water temperature in the lake was 29.1°C, but it became progressively colder after the 1960s as a result of the spring's discharge falling from 500 litres/second to 50 litres/second prior to the turn of the century (see 'Threats'). A number of additional springs and two other small lakes in the vicinity are also connected to the Peța River, but this species has not been recorded in any of them.<br/><br/>The lake was heavily-vegetated and supported two other endemic taxa, comprising the melanopsid gastropod <em>Microcolpia parreyssii</em>, which has been globally extinct since the mid-2010s, and water lily subspecies <em>Nymphaea lotus</em> var. <em>thermalis</em>, small numbers of which survive at several other locations in the Peța River system.<br/><br/>Racovitza's Rudd is omnivorous and feeds on aquatic invertebrates and algae, supplemented by smaller amounts of higher plant material.<br/><br/>The annual reproductive period extends from February to March, and the eggs are deposited among submerged vegetation.","This species' extinction in the wild was caused by continued decline in the extent and quality of habitat over a period of several decades, culminating in the drying of Lake Pețea during September 2014.<br/><br/>The primary driver of these events is understood to have been excessive abstraction of groundwater from the geothermal aquifer which feeds the Peța River. This water is partially utilised to heat local homes and guest houses, but also to supply business establishments associated with the wellness, recreational and therapeutic uses of the thermal waters, which are considered to have special properties due to the minerals they contain. The first dedicated tourist facilities were constructed during the 1970s, and extensive investment in new infrastructure during the 2000s prompted a shift from wellness to recreational tourism.<br/><br/>The natural discharge of the geothermal aquifer began to decline after several artesian wells became operational during the 1980s, which caused some smaller springs to dry out. By the mid-2000s, water was being legally abstracted from 29 individual sites, while an undetermined number of illicit boreholes supplying private residences had also been drilled.<br/><br/>Non-native fish taxa introduced to the Peța River include Topmouth Gudgeon (<em>Pseudorasbora parva</em>), Brown Bullhead (<em>Ameiurus nebulosus</em>) and a number of ornamental species that were presumably released by aquarists. The presence of these is likely to have increased resource competition and predation pressure on the Racovitza's Rudd population.<br/><br/>Moreover, the cooling water temperatures plausibly impacted recruitment by disrupting physiological processes associated with reproduction and altering the structure of planktonic and zoobenthic communities in the lake. Foraging and reproductive success may have been further compromised by agricultural (nutrients, pesticides and sediments) and domestic (garbage and wastewater) pollution from an affluent stream, which led to increased eutrophication, siltation and the development of a thick organic substrate layer due to overgrowth of the invasive plants <em>Ceratopteris thalictroides</em>,<em> Bacopa </em>sp.<em> and Elodea </em>sp..<br/><br/>The population size of Racovitza's Rudd is thus believed to have been somewhat reduced prior to dewatering of the lake, which took place over a period of several years. The sublacustrine source spring first became inactive during December 2011, when a sudden decline in depth and surface area was observed. Flow was briefly reestablished in spring 2012, but by the end of that year the lake had been reduced to a small pond measuring a few metres in diameter which was maintained only by intermittent pumping of water from a nearby borehole. These conditions were exacerbated by a series of consecutive dry summers, and in September 2014 the lake completely dried out. This pattern has been repeated in subsequent years, with active groundwater discharge restricted to a short period each spring. By 2017, the number of operational extraction wells had fallen by more than half, indicating severe depletion of the geothermal aquifer.<span class=""HwtZe"" lang=""en""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><span class=""jCAhz""><span class=""ryNqvb""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><span class=""HwtZe"" lang=""en""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><br/><span class=""HwtZe"" lang=""en""><span class=""jCAhz ChMk0b""><span class=""ryNqvb""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","This species' wild population became extinct in September 2014, following an extended period of declining habitat quality (see 'Threats').

Similar to other well-known coastal metropolitan areas bounded by mountains, the city's location at the base of the Serra do Mar trapped the air causing dangerous levels of pollution in the 1970s and 1980s. The smog produced by these industries was blown inland by the sea breeze to the large metropolitan area of São Paulo and the resulting acid rain degraded the rainforest of the Serra do Mar. The impact of this pollution on the environment and human health of inhabitants of Cubatão and São Paulo spawned campaigns that brought about changes to industrial practices that persist to this day. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the effects of severe habitat degradation, combined with additional pressure from a pathogen known to have negatively affected many stream-dwelling montane species, caused catastrophic declines in this species during the 1970s and 1980s from which it has not recovered.<br/><br/>The habitat in the Serra da Araracuara is intact and not threatened.","The species is known from the holotype collected in 1898 (Miranda-Ribeiro 1923) and one individual collected in the 1950s (D.

Multiple methods for determining the likelihood of extinction have used the sighting history of this species as a test dataset and each has determined that the species is extinct beyond reasonable doubt. The probability of the species being extinct from these models first exceeded 95% during the period between 1989 and the start of 2005. Separately, an expert-led assessment of the probability of extinction based on the severity and spatial extent of threats concluded there was 90% probability that it was extinct.&#160;Considering the last confirmed sighting of the species was in 1985 despite adequate survey of remaining habitat within the potential range, and in view of the threats to the species, its lack of mobility and restricted range, this species is considered to be Extinct. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species was presumed to be strongly sedentary since its small wings render it unable to fly long distances<strong></strong>. Some movements to highland lakes and ponds other than Lake Alaotra were thought to have occurred as a result of the degradation of its preferred habitat, as opposed to representing habitual movement<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).<strong> </strong>It was usually found in pairs, sometimes in association with <em> T. ruficollis</em><strong> </strong>(Langrand 1990). It was thought to have a flexible breeding season, with historical records of breeding in April-June and in January-March<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).<strong> Habitat </strong>Lake Alaotra is a large, shallow, brackish lake<strong></strong>. Its shores were historically covered with dense vegetation including papyrus and reeds, which may have been important for this species<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).<strong> Diet </strong>It fed almost exclusively on fish<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong></strong>(Langrand 1990)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<strong> Breeding site </strong>Nothing was known of its breeding ecology<strong> </strong><strong></strong>(Langrand 1990). <p></p>","Several major factors contributed to this species' extinction. The primary driver of the rapid population reduction and loss of most individuals is considered to be the introduction of the carnivorous fish<em>&#160;</em><em>Micropterus salmoides</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Channa striata</em><strong>&#160;</strong>(ZICOMA 1999), which caused adult mortality but more significantly reduced reproduction to near-zero. These fish were introduced to the Alaotra basin in the 1950s and very rapid population declines appear to have commenced shortly afterwards. Additional introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially&#160;<em>Tilapia</em>, probably depleted essential foods for the species<strong>&#160;</strong>(Pidgeon 1996). Conversion of natural habitat for agriculture also occurred at an increasing rate during this time, with deforestation resulting in sedimentation from soil erosion and water quality being lowered, and considerable area has been converted to rice farms<strong>&#160;</strong>(Wilmé 1994). The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra proliferated more recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;The final few individuals may have been lost through hybridisation with <em>T. ruficollis</em>, although this appears to have been occurring for a long time as the type series from 1932 includes a presumed hybrid (Delacour 1932, Collar and Stuart 1985, Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Poaching may also have played a role in the extinction of the species (Wilmé 1994), although larger-bodied waterbirds are thought to have always been the primary target of hunters (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000).  <p></p>","The species was described in 1932 from Lake Alaotra (Delacour 1932) and in 1960 grebe flocks on the lake contained <em>c. </em>50 individuals alongside Little Grebe <em>T. ruficollis </em>and Madagascar Little Grebe <em>T. pelzelnii</em>, but also a number of hybrids with <em>T. ruficollis&#160;</em>(Voous and Payne 1965, Collar and Stuart 1985). Thirteen specimens were collected at this time (Voous and Payne 1965), presumably out of the total of 50 (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000). Numerous other reports from a wider area are given in Collar and Stuart (1985), but none were documented and were subsequently considered to be in error for <em>T. pelzelnii. </em>In&#160;1982 <em>c. </em>12 individuals were identified as still present, along with several hybrids (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000). Two or three individuals were then recorded in 1985 near Andreba on Lake Alaotra, when the only known photographs of the species in the wild was taken (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000, P. Thompson. <em>in litt. </em>2022). There have been no further confirmed sightings despite considerable survey effort (Hawkins <em>et al. </em>2000). The sighting series for the species has been used in the development of models to determine extinction probability using both linear modelling and Bayesian approaches (Lee <em>et al. </em>2014, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017, 2019): these all conclude the species became extinct prior to 1995. Separately, an assessment of the likely impact of the combination of threats faced by the species concluded that the severity and extent indicated a 90% probability of extinction for the species (Keith <em>et al. </em>2017).",,"<em>Tachybaptus rufolavatus</em> was endemic to <strong>Madagascar</strong> and known chiefly from Lake Alaotra<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(ZICOMA 1999)<strong></strong>.

Thompson <em>in litt. </em>2022). After this an adult and an immature were reported as the species in 1986 (B. Dawson, unpublished report) and two individuals (also an adult and an immature) which may have been Alaotra Grebe were again reported&#160;in 1988 (D.

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, <em>H. affinis</em>&#160;was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","<em>Hemignathus affinis</em> inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Pratt<em> et al</em>. 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000&#160;m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to <em>H. hanapepe</em> in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, <strong></strong>Pratt<em> et al</em>. 1987, Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998, Reynolds <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong></strong>. It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","<p>Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.</p>  <p>Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>, dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>. With Europeans and Americans came Black <em>R. rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em>, cats <em>Felis catus</em>, mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, feral goats <em>Capra hircus</em>, cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>, deer <em>Axis axis</em>, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for <em>H. affinis</em> and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions.</p>  <p>Both avian malaria <em>Plasmodium relictum</em> and avian pox <em>Avipoxvirus spp.</em> are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for <em>Culex</em> and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe <em>et al.</em> 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of <em>Culex </em>will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).</p><p>The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa <em>Akialoa lanaiensis</em>, that occupied somewhat similar niches to <em>H. affinis</em>, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.</p><p></p>","After no sightings for more than 60 years, <em>Hemignathus affinis</em>&#160;was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of&#160;<em>Chlorodrepanis virens </em>and possibly <em>Pseudonestor xanthophrys </em>(Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources.

There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp<em> in litt.</em> 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009).

Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that <em>H. affinis&#160;</em>was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant&#160;2009).

The inaccessible sites can only be viewed through binoculars, and the Madeiran Large White was a conspicuous and mobile butterfly (it was often seen in urban areas) and would be easily seen and identified even from a distance, but no evidence of its presence was found during these intensive surveys, nor in the preceding 35 years. If this butterfly was still present on Maderia, there is no doubt that it would have been seen at least once since the last recording in 1986. For this reason, Wiemers <em>et al</em>.

However, a later study (Lace and Jones 1984) found it exclusively associated with laurel and tree heather habitats. Cabbage (<em>Brassica oleracea</em>) and Nasturtium (<em>Tropaeolum majus</em>) are the only known larval hostplants, but since these species were introduced to Madeira in the 15<sup>th</sup> Century, the butterfly must have utilised unknown native hostplants. The caterpillars lived in small groups, dispersing in the later instars, when they were ready to pupate. Hibernation took place in the pupal stage. This butterfly produced several generations a year and could be found from March until November. Detailed habitat descriptions are not available.","The reasons for the sudden decline of this species are unknown, but some relationship with the introduction and sudden mass occurrence of the Small White (<em>Pieris rapae</em>) appears probable.

Menkhorst (2009) reported it had declined almost to local extinction in north-western Victoria by the 1850s, well before the advent of red foxes or rabbits, and possibly before feral cats were present there.

Tortoises with up to 50%&#160;<em>abingdonii</em>&#160;genes have been reported from Volcán Wolf on northern Isabela, including first generation hybrids, but no pure individuals of&#160;<em>abingdonii</em>&#160;are known to exist (TEWG, 2015).&#160;This assessment incorporates contributions from&#160;the international workshop on&#160;Galápagos tortoises&#160;convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate&#160;in July 2012.","<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em> was a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on higher vegetation,&#160;in particular, low-hanging cactus pads. Pinta habitat, before its destruction by feral goats, was largely dry xeric brushland and grassland at lower elevations, with limited more mesic forest habitat at higher elevations.&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;cactus trees are dominant in much of the Arid and Transition Zones on the island and provide an important food resource for tortoises. Habitats are now recovering following goat eradication.","<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em>&#160;was heavily exploited by whalers and other mariners in the 19th century as on-board food supplies, which severely depleted the population.&#160;By the 20th century, few tortoises remained and some exploitation continued by local fishermen.&#160;In addition, extensive deforestation by goats, introduced to Pinta in 1959, destroyed tortoise habitat (Pritchard 1996).","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-impact population was estimated to have been about 2,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). The Pinta Giant Tortoise was heavily exploited and its population collapsed in the middle of the 19<sup>th </sup>century,&#160;followed by significant collecting in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and exploitation by local fishermen subsequently. The last surviving animal, Lonesome George, was collected from the wild in 1972 and transferred to the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, where he died on 24 June 2012. No further animals have been found on Pinta despite extensive surveys (Pritchard 1996).&#160;During the final goat eradication project (1998-2003), park ranger activity covered the island and yielded no sign of tortoises. In 2008, the Galápagos National Park Directorate carried out the last massive search for tortoises, but only found a few tortoise shells at the bottom of crevices (Cayot 2014).",,"<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em> occurred on Pinta [formerly Abingdon Island] in the&#160;Galápagos&#160;Islands of Ecuador. Pinta has a total surface area of 59.4 sq.km, of which 24.5 sq. km / 41% could potentially sustain tortoises (Gibbs, unpubl. data).",<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em> was historically exploited in the 19th century&#160;by whalers and other mariners as on-board food supplies.,Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulations: <em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em>&#160;is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975, prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. The entirety of Pinta Island, and therefore 100%&#160;of this species’&#160;native range, is protected as part of the Galapagos National Park.<br/><br/>Captive breeding attempts with Lonesome George, the last known individual of&#160;<em>C.&#160;abingdonii</em>, were undertaken&#160;off and on during&#160;the 40 years of his residence at the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, but he never reproduced.&#160;Goats were eradicated from Pinta in 1999 (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;Ecosystem restoration on Pinta needs to continue to secure its other biodiversity.&#160;For that reason in May 2010, thirty-nine sterilized adult tortoises of various hybrid origins were released on to Pinta to act as non-reproductive natural ecosystem engineers to initiate a more natural habitat restoration process (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013). An ongoing project to remove hybrid tortoises with partial Pinta ancestry from Volcán Wolf on Isabela to begin a captive breeding programme is underway. Their reproductive offspring will be released on to Pinta, followed by long-term monitoring of the population.",Neotropical,1972,false,false,Global

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996). A recent five-day survey of Santa Luzia failed to recover evidence of a surviving population (Miralles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2013), and these authors likewise concluded that this skink is now extinct. The most recent record of this species was a mandible of a juvenile collected from cat faeces on Santa Luzia in 2005, since when the cat population has increased and the invasive animals are now widespread on the island (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). Repeated surveys of Branco and Raso since this species was last recorded have also failed to rediscover it.",,"This species was endemic to the Cape Verde islands, where it had been recorded from the islets Branco and Raso (Schleich 1987, Bocage 1873). These islands have a combined area less than 10.7 km². Its area of occupancy would have been an estimated 7 km² (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2013). It appears to have historically been more widespread on the islands (Bocage 1873), with subfossils reported from São Vicente and Santa Luzia (Mateo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1997). It may also have occurred on São Nicolau, based on the reports of local fishermen, but evidence for this is lacking (Miralles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). Mateo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2005) reported finding partial remains of a juvenile in cat faeces on Santa Luzia, but a five-day survey of this island in 2006 failed to record the species (Miralles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2013). Additional subfossil remains have been found near a beach on this island (R.

It was also harvested for its skin, which was used to make shoes (Bocage 1873).",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are applicable for this skink, which has not been found in recent exhaustive surveys of its known sites and is presumed to be extinct.

Contemporary fossil evidence of the Sardinian Pika has been found on Corsica (France), Sardinia (Italy), and adjacent small Mediterranean islands (Angelone <em>et al.</em> 2008, Angelone and Cermak 2015).

Cetti's 1774 report of ""giant rats whose burrows are so abundant that one might think the surface of the soil has been turned over by pigs"" on the islet of Tavolara may refer to this species (Nowak 1999).

Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source,<strong>&#160;</strong>‘ie‘ie vine <em>Freycinetia arborea</em> (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).<br/><br/>Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions.&#160;Both avian malaria <em>Plasmodium relictum</em> and avian pox <em>Avipoxvirus</em> spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of <em>Culex</em> will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for <em>Culex</em> and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe <em>et al</em>. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L.

In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest.

Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Maui Akepa and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for food and nest-sites (Foster 2009).

Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the stick-nest rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there is little doubt that the species is Extinct.","Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). There are also historic records of it sheltering in tree hollows (Robinson 2023).<br/><br/>The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs, seeds and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999, McDowell <em>et al</em>. 2012). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of&#160; the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat <em>Leporillus conditor</em> are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm. 2011).<br/><br/>The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. The species was social, with nests sheltering several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest (Robinson 2023).<br/><br/>Radiocarbon dates of stick-nest rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson <em>et al</em>. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.","Predation by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> is likely to have been the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonised the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> in its range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of <em>Leporillus</em> has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). The decline happened from east to west and from south to north (Copley 1999). It is now extinct.<br/><br/>The date this species was last seen in the wild may have been as late as the 1970s, as a large rodent that was captured and released in 1970 in a cave west of the Canning Stock Route, Western Australia, may have been this species (Robinson and Burbidge 2008).

It was present all over Christmas Island, which was at the time mostly covered by tropical rainforest. Lister (1888) noted that ""they generally keep to the ground, but are able to climb trees"". Andrews (1900), who apparently was more impressed by their climbing ability, said they ""ascend trees to a great height"" in pursuit of fruits and young shoots, and ""I have often seen them run up the trailing stems of the lianas, and, in fact, they can climb as well as a squirrel"". Little is known of their diet, except that they were fond of fruits and young shoots. Andrews (1900) also noted that ""In the daytime these rats live in holes among the roots of trees, in decaying logs, and shallow burrows. They seem to breed all the year round.""","<p>Maclear's Rat was abundant in 1897-1898 while Andrews was on Christmas Island (Andrews 1900). By the time he returned to the island in 1908, he was confident that it and the other native rat species, the Bulldog Rat&#160;<em>Rattus nativitatis</em>, were extinct (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) speculated that introduced Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> had brought an epidemic disease to the island that wiped out both native rats. Nearly 100 years later, the mystery was finally solved by Wyatt <em>et al</em>. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (1888–1908) and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats). <br/> <br/> To Andrews, the disappearance of such an abundant animal in such a short time had to be due to disease because <em>R. rattus</em> was not present over the entire island. It was unreasonable therefore to assume that the native species had been out-competed by <em>R. rattus</em> all over the island (Andrews 1909). Two predators had been introduced to the island by 1908, cat and dog, but these were far too few to rid the island of the rats (Andrews 1900, 1909). Although Christmas Island had an increasing human settlement at Flying Fish Cove, roads now crossed the island, and there was active phosphate mining, most of the original forest remained and even collectively these human disturbances were unlikely to have caused significant declines in the populations of Maclear's Rat (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) also relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904. <br/> <br/> Pickering and Norris (1996) report on documents concerning Maclear's Rat that were uncovered at Oxford University, and specimens from the Zoological Collections, University Museum, Oxford University and the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge. The documents include notes for a lecture by K. R. Hanitsch who visited Christmas Island for five weeks in 1904 and was unable to locate either species of native rat. Dr. Durham, a pathologist, visited the island from November 1901 to March 1902, during which Durham collected 19 rat specimens. Pickering and Norris (1996) note that some of these specimens were of <em>R. macleari</em>, <em>R. rattus</em>, and some of varying degrees of hybrid between <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>. Hybridisation between the two species, with the implication that <em>R. macleari</em> was genetically swamped by <em>R. rattus,</em> was put forward as a contributing factor in the demise of <em>R. macleari</em> (Pickering and Norris 1996). However, hybridisation between the two species is implausible given the phylogenetic distance between them, and re-examination of specimens confirms that each belongs to one or the other species (Musser and Carleton 2005; Aplin and Rowe 2023). This is further supported by the molecular studies of Wyatt <em>et al</em>.

Its short tail and robust hands and feet demonstrate that it was equipped for life as a fossorial species (Thomas 1888, Forsyth Major 1900). Its skull was described as ""particularly small, slender, and delicate"" (Thomas 1888).<br/> <br/> The species was often seen in and around burrows, and, unlike the co-occurring&#160;<em>R. macleari</em>, it did not climb trees. Andrews (1900) provided the most substantial record of the species: ""They seem to live in small colonies in burrows, often among the roots of a tree, and occasionally several may be found living in the long, hollow trunk of a fallen and half-decayed sago-palm (<em>Arenga listeri</em>). The food consists of wild fruits, young shoots, and, I believe, the bark of some trees.""</p>","<p>The Bulldog Rat was last recorded by Andrews from his 10-month stay on Christmas Island 1897-1898 (Andrews 1900). Although the species was known from the settlement at Flying Fish Cove, Andrews never encountered them there and believed they were mainly confined to higher ground (Andrews 1900, 1909). In the hills, he described them as ""very numerous in places"", but less common than <em>R. macleari</em> (Andrews 1900). Andrews (1900) stated that ""it is difficult to avoid the belief that the former species [<em>R. nativitatis</em>] is being supplanted by the latter [<em>R. macleari</em>] in spite of the abundance of food.""<br/> <br/> By the time Andrews revisited the island in 1908, he was confident in pronouncing the species to be extinct (Andrews 1909). In 1904, Hanitsch visited the island hoping to collect specimens of the native rats, but was unable to locate either species (Pickering and Norris 1996). Durham visited the island from November of 1901 to March 1902 and collected <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>, but was unable to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em>, despite offering a reward to the local inhabitants (Pickering and Norris 1996). Pickering and Norris (1996) noted that Durham did not go far from Flying Fish Cove during his stay, thus he could well have missed <em>R. nativitatis</em>. However, Hanitsch's failure to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1904 likely means that the species was extinct by this time. Andrews (1909) related anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904, and these may have included <em>R. nativitatis</em>, but were likely to be <em>R. macleari</em>. <br/> <br/> The demise of the Bulldog Rat was rapid, going from locally common to extinct in less than eight years. The cause was an epidemic disease brought to the island by introduced Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em> (Andrews 1909; Aplin and Rowe 2023). Black Rats were introduced to the island by the S.S. Hindoustan in September 1900 (Green 2014). This hypothesis is supported by the study of&#160;Wyatt <em>et al</em>.

Over-hunting and severe deforestation appear to be the primary drivers of its extinction.","Historical reports suggest the species had high forest dependence, however it was hunted due to the damage it did to crops, so clearly occasionally ventured into more open areas, and apparently fed in coffee plantations (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014, Hume 2017). The species' morphology suggests it was an opportunistic forager that occupied all forest strata (Hume 2014). The species was likely omnivorous, as are most starlings, and nested in tree cavities (Hume 2017). Historical observations also suggest the species was a vertical migrant, breeding in mountain forests during summer (Hume 2014).","The primary causes of the species' extinction were undoubtedly deforestation and hunting. Historical reports suggest that the species primarily occupied the interior of forests (Hume 2017). As deforestation accelerated through the 1830s (Hume 2017), this would have caused the rapid decline of the species' habitat. The species did however move into coffee plantations where it would feed on insects that plagued the coffee flowers (Vinson 1877 translated from Hume 2014), but as plantations gave way to sugarcane during the 1830s, even this marginal habitat was lost (Hume 2017). As the species was also considered a pest, it was heavily hunted during the 1800s (Hume 2017). Supposedly, the species was easily approached, and hunters could take dozens at a time as a consequence (Cheke 1987, Hume 2017). There are also suggestions that disease contacted from introduced <em>Acroditheres tristris </em>(Common Mynas) and impacts from introduced cats and rats may also have caused declines, but as mynas occurred on the island as early as 1759 (Cheke and Hume 2008), and the species survived for decades alongside cats and rats, any declines from these threats are likely negligible (Hume 2017).",No extant population remains.,,<em>Fregilupus varius </em>was endemic to <strong>Réunion </strong>(to <strong>France</strong>).<p></p>,The species was heavily persecuted for the damage it did to crops (Hume 2017).,Terrestrial,,Afrotropical,1859,false,false,Global
